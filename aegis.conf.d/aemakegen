@Aegis provides a framework within which a team of developers may work
on many changes to a program independently, and Aegis coordinates
integrating these changes back into the master source of the program,
with as little disruption as possible.

Aegis simplifies the problems associated with multiple developers and
development trees by using a transaction-based approach to version
control, along with a web-browsable repository and an integrated testing
mechanism.

Several methods are provided for distrubuted version control using
Aegis, including tarballs and patches.  Signed-Off-By is also supported.@;
