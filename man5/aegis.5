Strings are C-style strings.
Whitespace (spaces, tabs and newlines) are ignored
except in strings or as they serve to separate tokens.

.I yacc (1)
grammar.

The types of the values must match those in the definition
of the file.
See the relevant man pages for more information.

Files which are rewritten by
.B \*(n)
will lose any comments placed in them.
When time fields are emitted by
.B \*(n)
they are usually followed by a human readable date in a comment.
