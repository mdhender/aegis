test_exempt = boolean;
.br
This field is true if it is not necessary
to test the change.
It is, in general, desirable to test all changes,
whether new functionality or a bug fix.
This is, however, a project management issue.
.TP 8n
test_baseline_exempt = boolean;
.br
This field is true if it is not necessary
to test the change against the baseline before it is changed.
The test of the baseline is required to fail;
this is to establish that the test has isolated the bug,
and that the change has fixed that isolated bug.
