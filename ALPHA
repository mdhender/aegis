	aegis (ee.j.iz)	n., a protection, a defence.

ALPHA SOFTWARE
	This is	an alpha version of the	aegis program.	This
	means that it is not the final product,	or even	a Beta
	version.  It probably has bugs,	and it has known
	limitations.  This version is intended for testing only,
	and should be used with	caution	in a "live" environment.
	That said, the harder you use it, the more useful the
	testing.  If you are still interested, the author would
	like to	know the following:

	1. The type of UNIX
		The author will	need to	know the type of UNIX you
		are using, and sometimes what version, or if it
		is not UNIX but	something else.	 The output of
		"uname -rs" is usually sufficent (but not all
		systems	have it).

	2. The Version Number
		In any information you send, please include the
		version	number reported	in the
		common/patchlevel.h file, or `aegis -vers` if you
		can get	it to compile.

	3. The Archive Site
		When and where you obtained this version of
		aegis.	If you tell me nothing else, tell me this
		(and, hopefully, why you did nothing else).

	4. Unpacking
		Did you	have problems unpacking	aegis?	This
		probably isn't a problem with the .tar.Z
		distribution, but you could have obtained a shar
		format copy.

	5. Building
		Did you	have problems building aegis?  This could
		have been the instructions included, it	could
		have been the Makefile,	it could have been
		problems configuring it, or anything else.

	6. Testing, Non-Set-Uid
		Did you	have problems with the tests?  Yes, the
		aegis program comes with tests!	 You could have

		had problems running them, or some of them could
		have failed.  If some tests fail but not others,
		please let me know which ones failed.

	7. Testing, Set-Uid-Root
		Did you	have problems with the tests when aegis
		was set-uid-root?  You could have had problems
		running	them, or some of them could have failed.
		If some	tests fail but not others, please let me
		know which ones	failed,	and include the	fact that
		aegis was set-uid-root at the time.

	8. Installation
		Did you	have problems installing aegis?	 This
		could have been	the instructions, or anything
		else.

	At this	point it would probably	be a very good idea to
	print out the manual entries and read them carefully.
	You will also want to print a copy of the User Guide; if
	you don't gave groff, there should be a	PostScript copy
	at the archive site.  It is a known flaw that the User
	Guide is incomplete, it	is something the author	is
	working	on "at this moment".  (See the PRINTED MANUALS
	section	of the BUILDING	file for more details.)

	9. The Example Project
		After reading the User Guide, it is often useful
		to manually run	through	the example in chapter 3.
		You will need to do more than one change,
		hopefully several; the first change is not
		representative of the system.  Did you manually
		do the example?	 Did you find flaws in the User
		Guide or manual	entries?

	10. Using Aegis
		Did you	have problems using aegis?  This is a
		whole can of worms.  If	possible, include a shell
		script similar to the tests which accompany
		aegis, which reproduces	the bug.  Exit code 1 on
		failure	(bug), exit code 0 on success (for when
		bug is fixed).

	11. The	Source Code
		Did you	read the code?	Did you	write some code?
		If you read the	code and found problems, fixed
		them, or extended aegis, these contributions are
		most welcome.  I reserve the right to modify or
		reject such contributions.

	The above list is inclusive, not exclusive.  Any and all
	feedback is greatly appreciated, as is the effort and
	interest required to produce it.

SOME HISTORY
	The idea for aegis did not come	full-blown into	my head
	in the shower, as some of my programs do, but rather from
	working	for a software shop which used a simplistic form
	of something similar.  That system was held together by
	chewing-gum and	string,	it was written in a disgusting
	variant	of Basic, and by golly the damn	thing worked
	(mostly).  The aegis program is	nothing	like it, owes
	none of	its code to that system, and is	far more
	versatile.

	Since that company decided to close down our section, we
	all moved on simultaneously (all 60 of us), sometimes
	working	together, and sometimes	not, but always	keeping
	in touch.  With	suggestions and	conversations with some
	of them	early in 1990, the manual entries for aegis took
	shape, and formed most of the design document for aegis.
	The rest of the	design document	will eventually	appear in
	the "model" section of the user	manual.

	Since getting the first	glimmerings of a functional aegis
	late in	1990 it	is increasingly	obvious	that I never want
	to be without it ever again.  All of my	sources	that I
	modify are instantly placed under aegis, as is anything	I
	distribute.  All code I	write for myself, and all new
	code I write for my employer, goes under aegis.	 Why?
	Because	it has fewer bugs!

	Example: one of	the sources I carry with me from job to
	job is "cook", my dependency maintenance tool.	Cook had
	existed	for 3 years before aegis appeared on the scene,
	and I used it daily.  When I placed cook under aegis, I
	found 6	bugs!  Since then I have found even more.  Not
	only are there now fewer bugs, but they	never come back,
	because	the regession test suite always	grows.
