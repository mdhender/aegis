# Work out if there is a diff2html program on the PATH.
# This can't be worked out by ./configure, because this happens on the
# machine which *builds* the RPM, and not the machine on which the rpm
# is installed.  Plus, they could run aeget in a chroot jail, and
# not put diff2html in the jail with it.
