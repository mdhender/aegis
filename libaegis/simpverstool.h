/**
  * The simple_version_tool class is used to represent the current state
  * of a simple version recording tool.
  *
  * It stores all versions end-to-end in a compressed file, with RFC
  * 882 headers between, to hold things like the version number and the
  * content length.  The trick is, it's all compressed using GNU gzip.
  *
  * The idea is the same one as behind xdelta (RFC nnnn).  Because
  * all the versions are substantially similar most of the time, the
  * compression state carries over between versions, resulting in very
  * high compression ratios for versions later in the file.
  *
  * We put the head revsion first, simply because it is accessed most
  * often.  It doesn't change the premise, or the results.
  *
  *
  * End-to-end issues:
  *
  * Each version also has an Adler 32 checksum stored in the header.
  * This lets us check that the data is valid when we extract it.  The
  * GNU gzip format also has an Adler 32 checksum in the trailer, and
  * this is used for for confirming that previous version are still
  * valid when we do a new checkin.  The checksum in each version is
  * because we don't always read to the end of the compressed file, ans
  * to the checksum in the trailer is not verified.
