/**
  * The dir_functor_rm_dir_tree class is used to represent an object
  * which is able to remove directoryt trees when called by the dir_walk
  * function.
  *
  * This class's () operator is the function that actually deletes
  * things out of the directory tree as it is walked.  Note that the
  * directory should be deleted last, after all contents have been
  * nuked.
  *
  * Some sleight-of-hand is involved here, as this function pushes extra
  * stuff onto the lists of things to be deleted, rather than really
  * doing it itself.
