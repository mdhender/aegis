Package: aegis
Architecture: any
Description: transaction-based software configuration management (DVCS)
 Aegis provides a framework within which a team of developers may work
 on many changes to a program independently, and Aegis coordinates
 integrating these changes back into the master source of the program,
 with as little disruption as possible.
 .
 Aegis simplifies the problems associated with multiple developers and
 development trees by using a transaction-based approach to version
 control, along with a web-browsable repository and an integrated testing
 mechanism.
 .
 Several methods are provided for distrubuted version control using
 Aegis, including tarballs and patches.  Signed-Off-By is also supported.
