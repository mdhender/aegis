  * Reply-to: cwebster@ec.rr.com
  * To: Aegis Mailing List <aegis-users@auug.org.au>
  * Subject: [Aegis] Bug Report: aechown doesn't update recipient's user state
    file
  * Date: Mon, 18 Jun 2012 12:25:03 -0400 (19/06/12 02:25:03)
  * Host platform: CentOS 6.2
  * Architecture: i386 and x86_64
  * Aegis versions affected: 4.24.4-rc1 and 4.24.3-1
  * [Symptoms]
  * Expected results: Developer is accustomed to omitting project and change
  * arguments in aegis commands when current working directory is within the
  * development tree.
  * Actual results: After executing aechown the recipient developer receives
  * an error when attempting to run aegis commands within his development
  * directory, requiring him to use arguments for project and change number.
  * We don't use aechown very often so this went unnoticed for some time. We
  * installed a previous version of Aegis (4.24.3-1) and found problem
  * present there as well.
  * [Problem Analysis]
  * Whenever Aegis admin changes owner of a change from one developer to
  * another, only the donor user's state file is modified to remove the
  * change. The recipient's state file is not touched. There are no errors
  * or warning raised when this happens, leading us to believe the code is
  * doing what it thinks is right.
  * Oddly, however, if the recipient is the Aegis admin executing the
  * aechown command both donor and recipient state files are properly
  * modified.
  * Only state files are affected. Development directories are properly
  * moved to the new developer and no other errors are raised.
  * [Bug in aechown.cc] Travis Clark, one of our developers and my primary
  * sysadmin, discovered that the routine apparently designed to modify the
  * user state files incorrectly points to the Aegis administrator
  * (cid.get_up()) state file instead of the recipient (up2) state files.
  * This explains why it only works if the Aegis admin is the intended
  * recipient.
  * [Fix]
  * Replaced "cid.get_up()" with "up2" as shown in patch below.

  * There is a new test_strverscmp command, which allows you to compare two
    version strings from the command line.  This is used to compare the g++
    version number, in order to figure out the names and availability of various
    options.  The results of this figuring out are cached, for some tiny
    improvement in build time.

  * When aeipass sleeps, we have to add a second because if there is a script
    which is blocked waiting on the baseline lock, it is possible for the
    aeipass to complete and the script to copy files (etc) and build ALL WITHIN
    THE ONE SECOND.  This means that time stamps for that second can be broken.
    This is particularly evident in Aegis' own test scripts, however the problem
    is more general.  The solution is to add a single second, so that any post-
    aeipass activity is guaranteed to be in a later second than the baseline
    file stamps.

  * When aeipass sleeps, we have to add a second because if there is a script
    which is blocked waiting on the baseline lock, it is possible for the
    aeipass to complete and the script to copy files (etc) and build ALL WITHIN
    THE ONE SECOND.  This means that time stamps for that second can be broken.
    This is particularly evident in Aegis' own test scripts, however the problem
    is more general.  The solution is to add a single second, so that any post-
    aeipass activity is guaranteed to be in a later second than the baseline
    file stamps.

  * "Files exist in the install directories without corresponding entries in the

    are files placed in the install directories without corresponding entries in
    the "%files" section of the spec file.  From a practical standpoint, the

  * "Files exist in the install directories without corresponding entries in the
    spec file. rpmbuild v4 and later will not allow a build to continue if there
    are files placed in the install directories without corresponding entries in
    the "%files" section of the spec file.  From a practical standpoint, the

    motivated by SourceForge having 10 web servers, but only one /tmp shared
    amongst them.  This means that pid-based file names are not sufficiently
    unique.  Temporary file names are now based on UUIDs.

  * the 'aecpu -unch' step of the 'aedist -rec', needed to catch changes already
    present has some drawback related to changes being received, slightly
    modified, into the same repository that originated them.
  * 1) it is possible that received change may non develop_end because the
    changes requires some test, but the file was not modified with respect to
    the original change so thay will be removed.
  * 2) when a changes originate at repository A and fails for some reasons in B,
    the B developer may need to edit some files in the same change. The he will
    send the archive to the originating repository, there the change will be
    imported with a different UUID.  Then site B will see the changes as
    missing, based on UUID, but the content will be the same so it will download
    more and more the same change without being able to end the development
    because it will not contains any difference and the 'acpu- unch' step will
    empty the development directory.

  * The -Change option now accepts more than just a change number.  It now
    accepts many forms similar to those used by the ${version} substitution,
    allowing its output to be used directly as command line input; forms such as
    -c 1.2.C34 and --c=5.6.D78 are now understood to imply a --branch option as
    well as either --change or --change-from-delta, respectively.  In addition,
    you may prepend a project name, to imply the --project option as well; form
    such as -c aegis.4.15.C28 are understood.

    with this change.  Additional refactoring of command line option handling
    may be worthwhile.

  * This change adds the ability to specify extra arguments for "list"
    functions.
  * This is unsuitable for many of the list functions, but will be helpful for
    some. In particular, a username could be passed to the list_user_changes()
    function.
  * aegis/ael.c:struct table_ty now contains a maximum number of extra arguments
    allowed for each of the list functions.
  * The initialisation of aegis/ael.c:table[] now contains the expected number
    of max arguments for each list function. For those that are non-zero,
    subsequent changesets will allow those functions to accept a username as the
    extra arguments.
  * To allow easy future expansion, where some functions may want two or more
    extra arguments, the args are assembled into a string_list_ty list, the
    address of which is passed into the appropriate list function.
  * Unfortunately, this changeset has to touch many, many files. However, the
    only real functionality change is contained in aegis/ael.c
  * Assuming this concept is acceptable, appropriate list functions will be able
    to process their extra arguments in later changesets.
  * My thanks to Matt Lee for this patch.

  * This change fixes some build problems, so that other developers at other
    wise can develop Aegis using Aegis.
  * - PDF documents are only created if Cook can find ps2pdf, psselect and ptx.
  * - tarball sare only created if Cook can find tardy
  * - The etc/CHANGES.[34] files are replaced by a single etc/CHANGES file, so
    the actual branch numbers are now irrelevant.
  * - the Howto be a Developer chapter now has the right aenbr instructions, and
    mentions the architecture issues (which should be mostly gone, because of
    recent aeca -fa and aedist -rec changes).
  * - the gettext .mo files are only built if the magcat command can be found
    (this being the best way to also determnine if msgfmt --compendium ialso
    exists).

    when I edit some change or project attrbiutes that leaves backup files from

  * This change adds a completely redundant .po file for the benefit of a brain-
    dead server being used by the internationalization teams.  Their robot needs
    an "i18n/everything.pot" file, rather than have it split into the "lib/en/
    LC_MESSAGES/*.po" files.  Sheesh.
  * The probelm with this approach, for anyone who can't work it out is
  * 1. what happens when things other than .po files get translated?  It makes
    no sense to say "just cantenate together all your man pages and reference
    manuals", so why does it make sense to catenate together all of the .po
    files?
  * 2. what happens when things other than .po files get translated?  Where do
    you put them?  man1/aegis.1 and then man1/aegis.en.1?  By using a directory
    tree lib/LANG/blahblah this falls out cleanly.

  * This change fixes a bug where the wrong version was retrieved from history,
    when the file was changed later in the branch BUT was unchanged at the time
    of the specified delta.
  * The offending function, change_branch_deltadate_to_edit, has been removed.
    The fix was to use the more efficient (and already existing) project_file_
    roll_forward mechanism.
  * My thanks to John Darrington for reporting this problem.
  * This change also removes the inefficient and defective change_branch_delta_
    date_to_edit and change_branch_delta)_to_edit mechanisms, as they are no
    longer used anywhere.

    appears that HP/UX over NFS can't cope with 0600 lockfile permissions.  It
    needs to be 0666 (similar to Cygwin).

    command, new_test_command, new_test_undo_command.
  * The man pages for the file manipulation commands have been updated to
    reference the notification commands.  Weird how many years they have been
    missing from the man pages!
  * Also, the missing aemvu man page has been added.

    about what it considers a temporary directory.  This is only relevant in

  * This change cope with recent GNU Bison changes.  When you ask for bison to
    generate a .h file, it now also generates #ifdef insulation.  The problem is
    that in some places, two grammars are used simultaneously with the same
    lexer, so the insulation needs to be edityied, just like the rest of the YY
    symbols.  Of course, if they'd actually *used* a yy symbol, this change
    wouldn't have been necessary.  Instead, they used Y_TAB_H, so extra sed
    arguments are needed.

    that integration does not pass since it tried to run the script just at the

    while the baseline hasnt been built yet.

  * This change is part two of reworking the columnizing code. This section
    reworks the internal col_* interface.  This results in columns which are
    derived output_* classes, allowing re-use of the output_* and wide_output_*
    interfaces.
  * As a result of th work, it would be possible (but NOT implemented in this
    change) to write comma separated value (CSV) output, or even direct HTML
    output.
  * The immediate benefit is that the -UNFormatted option no longer truncates
    any of the fields, though it still only prints the first line of each
    column.

    been performed,and leave the file in the change, even when the actual
    contents are unchanged.  This facilitates cross branch merging in a much
    more automatic fashion.
