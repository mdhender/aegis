  * We don't use aechown very often so this went unnoticed for some time. We
  * installed a previous version of Aegis (4.24.3-1) and found problem
  * present there as well.
  * [Problem Analysis]
  * Whenever Aegis admin changes owner of a change from one developer to
  * another, only the donor user's state file is modified to remove the
  * change. The recipient's state file is not touched. There are no errors
  * or warning raised when this happens, leading us to believe the code is
  * doing what it thinks is right.
  * Oddly, however, if the recipient is the Aegis admin executing the
  * aechown command both donor and recipient state files are properly
  * modified.
  * Only state files are affected. Development directories are properly
  * moved to the new developer and no other errors are raised.
  * [Bug in aechown.cc] Travis Clark, one of our developers and my primary
  * sysadmin, discovered that the routine apparently designed to modify the
  * user state files incorrectly points to the Aegis administrator
  * (cid.get_up()) state file instead of the recipient (up2) state files.
  * This explains why it only works if the Aegis admin is the intended
  * recipient.
  * [Fix]
  * Replaced "cid.get_up()" with "up2" as shown in patch below.

    is set, which fixes all of the numerous places there are assumtions (and
    asserts) that the edit_origin field is set.

    (soon, soon) we still have to continue to work with repositories with this

  * There is a new test_strverscmp command, which allows you to compare two
    version strings from the command line.  This is used to compare the g++
    version number, in order to figure out the names and availability of various
    options.  The results of this figuring out are cached, for some tiny
    improvement in build time.
  * Most importantly, this allows us to avoid an erroneous warning which stop
    the build working on some (older) versions of G++

    posting guidelines mandated a Makefile, and stringly recommended a MANIFEST
    file (one line per file to describe all the files in the project).	This

  * When aeipass sleeps, we have to add a second because if there is a script
    which is blocked waiting on the baseline lock, it is possible for the
    aeipass to complete and the script to copy files (etc) and build ALL WITHIN
    THE ONE SECOND.  This means that time stamps for that second can be broken.
    This is particularly evident in Aegis' own test scripts, however the problem
    is more general.  The solution is to add a single second, so that any post-
    aeipass activity is guaranteed to be in a later second than the baseline
    file stamps.

  * A bug has been fixed which caused aeipass to assign UUID to files when at
    branch integration pass time.
  * This can happen if the changes was integrated with an old Aegis release,
    lacking support for file's UUID.  This bug make it possible to have the
    history for a file split into two part, one accessible via the file_name,
    the other accesible using the UUID.

  * "Files exist in the install directories without corresponding entries in the
    spec file. rpmbuild v4 and later will not allow a build to continue if there
    are files placed in the install directories without corresponding entries in
    the "%files" section of the spec file.  From a practical standpoint, the

  * the 'aecpu -unch' step of the 'aedist -rec', needed to catch changes already
    present has some drawback related to changes being received, slightly
    modified, into the same repository that originated them.
  * 1) it is possible that received change may non develop_end because the
    changes requires some test, but the file was not modified with respect to
    the original change so thay will be removed.
  * 2) when a changes originate at repository A and fails for some reasons in B,
    the B developer may need to edit some files in the same change. The he will
    send the archive to the originating repository, there the change will be
    imported with a different UUID.  Then site B will see the changes as
    missing, based on UUID, but the content will be the same so it will download
    more and more the same change without being able to end the development
    because it will not contains any difference and the 'acpu- unch' step will
    empty the development directory.

  * This change adds the ability to specify extra arguments for "list"
    functions.
  * This is unsuitable for many of the list functions, but will be helpful for
    some. In particular, a username could be passed to the list_user_changes()
    function.
  * aegis/ael.c:struct table_ty now contains a maximum number of extra arguments
    allowed for each of the list functions.
  * The initialisation of aegis/ael.c:table[] now contains the expected number
    of max arguments for each list function. For those that are non-zero,
    subsequent changesets will allow those functions to accept a username as the
    extra arguments.
  * To allow easy future expansion, where some functions may want two or more
    extra arguments, the args are assembled into a string_list_ty list, the
    address of which is passed into the appropriate list function.
  * Unfortunately, this changeset has to touch many, many files. However, the
    only real functionality change is contained in aegis/ael.c
  * Assuming this concept is acceptable, appropriate list functions will be able
    to process their extra arguments in later changesets.
  * My thanks to Matt Lee for this patch.

    the actual branch numbers are now irrelevant.
  * - the Howto be a Developer chapter now has the right aenbr instructions, and
    mentions the architecture issues (which should be mostly gone, because of
    recent aeca -fa and aedist -rec changes).

aegis (4.3.D009-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This change adds a completely redundant .po file for the benefit of a brain-
    dead server being used by the internationalization teams.  Their robot needs
    an "i18n/everything.pot" file, rather than have it split into the "lib/en/
    LC_MESSAGES/*.po" files.  Sheesh.
  * The probelm with this approach, for anyone who can't work it out is
  * 1. what happens when things other than .po files get translated?  It makes
    no sense to say "just cantenate together all your man pages and reference
    manuals", so why does it make sense to catenate together all of the .po
    files?
  * 2. what happens when things other than .po files get translated?  Where do
    you put them?  man1/aegis.1 and then man1/aegis.en.1?  By using a directory
    tree lib/LANG/blahblah this falls out cleanly.

aegis (4.2.D034-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This change adds some of the aepatch functionality to aedist. Specifically,
    it adds patches to outgoing file modifications, so that these can be used in
    preference to the whole-file source if at all possible. This results in
    fewer messy merges at the receiving end (which doesn't have the necessary
    file version information to actually perform a merge).

  * This change updates the parsing of Aegis' database files (and inoput files,
    such as the project config file, change attribute files, etc, to accept
    string constants in the was ANSI C does.  In particular, two adjacent string
    constants are automatically catenated.  This means you can keep nice
    indentation even when your strings get too long, rather than use ugly

  * This change cope with recent GNU Bison changes.  When you ask for bison to
    generate a .h file, it now also generates #ifdef insulation.  The problem is
    that in some places, two grammars are used simultaneously with the same
    lexer, so the insulation needs to be edityied, just like the rest of the YY
    symbols.  Of course, if they'd actually *used* a yy symbol, this change
    wouldn't have been necessary.  Instead, they used Y_TAB_H, so extra sed
    arguments are needed.

  * perhaps just the addition of

  * This change is part two of reworking the columnizing code. This section
    reworks the internal col_* interface.  This results in columns which are
    derived output_* classes, allowing re-use of the output_* and wide_output_*
    interfaces.
  * As a result of th work, it would be possible (but NOT implemented in this
    change) to write comma separated value (CSV) output, or even direct HTML
    output.
  * The immediate benefit is that the -UNFormatted option no longer truncates
    any of the fields, though it still only prints the first line of each
    column.
