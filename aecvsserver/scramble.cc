// MANIFEST: functions to manipulate scrambles
//
// Taken from cvs-1.12.5/src/scramble.c...
//

#include <mem.h>
#include <scramble.h>

//
// Trivially encode strings to protect them from innocent eyes (i.e.,
// inadvertent password compromises, like a network administrator
// who's watching packets for legitimate reasons and accidentally sees
// the password protocol go by).
//
// This is NOT secure encryption.
//
// It would be tempting to encode the password according to username
// and repository, so that the same password would encode to a
// different string when used with different usernames and/or
// repositories.  However, then users would not be able to cut and
// paste passwords around.  They're not supposed to anyway, but we all
// know they will, and there's no reason to make it harder for them if
// we're not trying to provide real security anyway.
//

//
// Map characters to each other randomly and symmetrically, A <--> B.
//
// We divide the ASCII character set into 3 domains: control chars (0
// thru 31), printing chars (32 through 126), and "meta"-chars (127
// through 255).  The control chars map _to_ themselves, the printing
// chars map _among_ themselves, and the meta chars map _among_
// themselves.  Why is this thus?
//
// No character in any of these domains maps to a character in another
// domain, because I'm not sure what characters are valid in
// passwords, or what tools people are likely to use to cut and paste
// them.  It seems prudent not to introduce control or meta chars,
// unless the user introduced them first.  And having the control
// chars all map to themselves insures that newline and
// carriage-return are safely handled.

// SCRAMBLE and DESCRAMBLE work like this:
//
// scramble(STR) returns SCRM, a scrambled copy of STR.  SCRM[0] is a
// single letter indicating the scrambling method.  As of this
// writing, the only valid method is 'A', but check the code for more
// up-to-date information.  The copy will have been allocated with
// xmalloc().
//
// descramble(SCRM) returns STR, again in its own xmalloc'd space.
// descramble() uses SCRM[0] to determine which method of unscrambling
// to use.  If it does not recognize the method, it dies with error.
