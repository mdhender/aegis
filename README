	aegis (ee.j.iz)	n., a protection, a defence.

DESCRIPTION
	Aegis is a CASE	tool with a difference.	 In the	spirit of
	the UNIX Operating System, Aegis is a small component
	designed to work with other programs.

	Many CASE systems attempt to provide everything, from
	bubble charts to source	control	to compilers.  Users are
	trapped	with the components supplied by	the CASE system,
	and if you don't like one of the components (it	may be
	too limited, for instance), then that is just tough.

	In contrast, UNIX provides many	components of a	CASE
	system - compilers, editors, dependency	maintenance tools
	(such as make),	source control tools (such as RCS).  You
	may substitute the tool	of your	choice if you don't like
	the ones supplied with the system - gcc, jove, cake, to
	name just a few.  Aegis	adds to	this list with software
	configuration management, and true to UNIX philosophy,
	Aegis does not dictate the choice of any of the	other
	tools (although	it may stretch them to their limits).

	Enough hype, what is it	that Aegis does?  Just what is
	software configuration management?  This question is
	sufficiently broad as to require a book	in answer.  In
	essence, Aegis is a project change supervisor.	It
	provides a framework within which a team of developers
	may work on many changes to a program independently, and
	Aegis coordinates integrating these changes back into the
	master source of the program, with as little disruption
	as possible.  Resolution of contention for source files,
	a major	headache for any project with more than	one
	developer, is one of Aegis's major functions.

	It should be noted that	Aegis is a developer's tool, in
	the same sense as make or RCS are developer's tools.  It
	is not a manager's tool	- it does not provide progress
	tracking or manage work	allocation.

BENEFITS
	So why should you use Aegis?

	Aegis uses a particular	model of the development of
	software projects.  This model has a master source (or

Reference Manual	      Aegis				1

Read Me(Aegis)					   Read	Me(Aegis)

	baseline) of a project,	and a team of developers creating
	changes	to be made to this baseline.  When a change is
	complete, it is	integrated with	the baseline, to become
	the new	baseline.  Each	change must be atomic and self-
	contained, no change is	allowed	to cause the baseline to
	cease to work.	"Working" is defined as	passing	it's own
	tests.	The tests are considered part of the baseline.
	Aegis provides support for the developer so that an
	entire copy of the baseline need not be	taken to change	a
	few files, only	those files which are to be changed need
	to be copied.

	In order to ensure that	changes	are unable to cause the
	baseline to cease to work, Aegis mandates that changes be
	accompanied by at least	one test, and that all such tests
	be known to complete successfully.  These steadily
	accumulated tests form an ever increasing regression test
	suite for all later changes.  There is also a mandatory
	review stage for each change to	the baseline.  While
	these requirements may be relaxed per-change or	even per-
	project, doing so potentially compromises the "working"
	definition of the baseline.

	The win	in using Aegis is that there are O(n)
	interactions between developers	and the	baseline.
	Contrast this with a master source which is being edited
	directly by the	developers - there are O(n!)
	interactions between developers	- this makes adding "just
	one more" developer a potential	disaster.

	Another	win is that the	project	baseline always	works.
	Always having a	working	baseline means that a version is
	always available for demonstrations, or	those "pre-
	release	snapshots" we are always forced	to provide.

	The above advantages are all very well - for management
	types.	Why should Joe Average Programmer use Aegis?
	Recall that RCS	provides file locking, but only	for one
	file at	a time.	 Aegis provides	the file locking,
	atomically, for	the set	of files in the	change.	 Recall
	also that RCS locks the	file the instant you start
	editing	it.  This makes	popular	files a	project
	bottleneck.  Aegis allows concurrent editing, and a
	resolution mechanism just before the change must be
	integrated, meaning fewer delays for J.A.Programmer.

BUILDING
	Instructions on	how to build and test Aegis are	to be
	found in the BUILDING file included in this distribution.

SOME HISTORY
	The idea for Aegis did not come	full-blown into	my head
	in the shower, as some of my programs do, but rather from
	working	in a software shop which used a	simplistic form
	of something similar.  That system was held together by
	chewing-gum and	string,	it was written in a disgusting
	variant	of Basic, and by golly the damn	thing worked
	(mostly).  Aegis is nothing like it, owes none of its
	code to	that system, and is far	more versatile.	 It turns
	out that the system used is nothing new, and is	described
	in many	SCM textbooks; it is the result	of systematically
	resolving development issues for large-ish teams.

	Since that company decided to close down our section (the
	company	was under attack by a hostile takeover bid) we
	all moved on simultaneously (all 60 of us), sometimes
	working	together, and sometimes	not, but always	keeping
	in touch.  With	suggestions and	conversations with some
	of them	early in 1990, the manual entries for Aegis took
	shape, and formed most of the design document for Aegis.

	Since getting the first	glimmerings of a functional Aegis
	late in	1990 it	is increasingly	obvious	that I never want
	to be without it ever again.  All of my	sources	that I
	modify are instantly placed under Aegis, as is anything	I
	distribute.  All code I	write for myself, and all new
	code I write for my employer, goes under Aegis.	 Why?
	Because	it has fewer bugs!

	Example: one of	the sources I carry with me from job to
	job is "cook", my dependency maintenance tool.	Cook had
	existed	for 3 years before Aegis appeared on the scene,
	and I used it daily.  When I placed cook under Aegis, I
	found 6	bugs!  Since then I have found a few more.  Not
	only are there now fewer bugs, but they	never come back,
	because	the regression test suite always grows.

RELEASE	NOTES
	For excruciating detail, and also acknowledgments of
	those who generously sent me feedback, please see the
	etc/CHANGES.*  files included in this distribution.

	A number of features have been added to	Aegis with this
	release.  A few	of them	are detailed here:

   Version 3.8
	* Some users were unable to build the previous release,
	due to inconsistent wide character support by the various
	UNIX vendors.  This has	now been fixed.

	* There	are two	new substitutions, trim_directory and
	trim_extension,	which are useful for constructing file
	templates.  These can be very useful in	constructing
	skeletons of C++ classes.

   Version 3.7
	* The aeif(1) and aerf(1) commands now have a new
	--reason option, to specify the	failure	reason on the
	command	line, rather than in a file.

	* Some file operations are now faster.	Mostly,	this
	applies	to operations which mention many files,	and to
	projects with large numbers of files.  Smaller projects
	may not	notice any improvement.

	* There	is a new --delta-date option to	the aecp(1)
	command, allowing deltas to be extracted by date.  This
	change also had	the side-effect	of making extraction by
	delta number more accurate on branches.

	* There	is a new --base-relative option	to most	of the
	file manipulation commands, aecp(1), aenf(1), etc.  This
	option may be used to specify that relative filenames are
	relative to the	base of	the source tree, rather	than the
	current	directory.  There is also a related user
	preference, see	aeuconf(5) for more information.

	* There	is a new ``aeclean'' command.  It can be used to
	clean your development directories of non-source files.
	See aeclean(1) for more	information.

	* The aeb(1) command now passes	through	arguments of the
	form name=value, on the	assumption that	these are
	variable assignments for th ebuild tool.  Previously,
	they were ``resolved'' as if they were file names.

	* A serious bug	in the error and interrupt handling has
	been fixed.  This bug would sometimes case Aegis to hang,
	and eventually run out of stack, when the user attempted
	to interrupt Aegis using ^C.

Reference Manual	      Aegis				6

   Version 3.6
	* The diff3_command field of the project config	file has
	been replaced by a merge_command field.	 It works exactly
	the same way, but Aegis	moves the files	around first, so
	that the output	replaces the change source file.  This
	results	in fewer ``lost'' merges.  Those of you	who have
	been hacking the diff3_command to move the files around
	will need to take the moves out	when you rename	the
	diff3_command field to be the new merge_command	field.

	* The columnizing functions used by the	report generator
	and the	listings has been enhanced to understand
	international character	sets.  This allows native
	character sets to be used in comments and descriptions,
	without	getting	gibberish (C escapes) in the output.

	* There	is a new shell_safe_filenames field in the
	project	config file.  This field controls whether
	filenames are required to be free of shell special
	characters.  This field	defaults to true if not	set, so
	if you are using any ``interesting'' filenames,	you may
	need to	explicitly set this field to false.  (You still
	can't use spaces or international characters in
	filenames.)

	* There	is a new ${quote} substitution for insulating
	shell special characters in filenames in the commands in
	the project config file.

	* A number of bugs relating to environment variables have
	been corrected;	this will make the aereport and	aefind
	commands behave	more consistently, with	respect	to the
	aegis command.

	* A bug	has been fixed which caused the	final newline of
	new test files to be omitted.

	* A bug	which prevented	the ``aeb -minimum'' option from
	working	in any non-trivial case	has been fixed.

   Version 3.5

Reference Manual	      Aegis				7

Read Me(Aegis)					   Read	Me(Aegis)

	* A bug	was fixed in the lock waiting code.  Aegis will
	now correctly wait for locks when there	are several users
	blocking on the	same lock.

   Version 3.4
	* There	is a new ``aegis -clone'' command, used	to
	replicate changes across branches.  See	aeclone(1) for
	more information.

	* There	is a new ``-No-Wait'' command line option, which
	asks for a fatal error if a lock cannot	be obtained
	immediately; this applies to all commands which	takes
	locks.	See aeuconf(5) for more	information.

   Version 3.3
	This release is	a bug fix release, and mostly install and
	portability bug, at that.

	* The problem with errno defines messing up glue.c has
	been fixed.

	* Numerous fixes to the	wide character support,	to cope
	with the vagueries of wide character support on	many
	platforms.

	* The problem with the LINES and COLS environment
	variables messing up testing have been fixed.  Some tests
	gave false negatives because of	this.

	* There	is a new aeb -minimum option, for use with
	symbolic links,	only, which has	a minimal set of source
	file links, rather than	everything in the baseline.

   Version 3.2
	* There	are some additional reports available via the web
	interface.  They are mainly to extract error causes and
	trends from the	project	history	statistics.

	* There	have been a number of minor bug	fixes concerning
	the handling of	old 2.3	projects.  This	should ease
	transition for users with existing 2.3 projects.

	* A bug	in aecp	-delta has been	fixed, where Aegis was
	trying to find change state files one branch level too
	high.

	* There	is now a re-try	performed when a stale NFS file
	handle error is	detected.  This	should make it easier for
	some sites which are heavily networked.

	* There	have been some improvements to the way Control-C
	is handled.  It	should be more responsive when waiting
	for locks.

Reference Manual	      Aegis				8

Read Me(Aegis)					   Read	Me(Aegis)

	* Project administrators may now end development of a
	branch.	 Since branches	can endure for months or years,
	the orginal branch creator may have moved on.  This copes
	with this situation.

   Version 3.1
	Version	3.0 was	not used by many sites.	 It was	available
	as beta	software for about a year, in numerous
	incarnations.  Version 3.1 is the first	completely stable
	version	since adding full branching support.

   Version 3.0
	Version	3.0 is fully backwards compatible with earlier
	versions, however once a project has been used under 3.0,
	it will	not be possible	to revert, e.g.	to version 2.3,
	without	restoring the project's	``info'' directory from
	backup.	 While this was	generally true of previous
	releases, any additional state information was usually
	undo-able with vi(1).  This time the process is	much more
	involved because the project state files and the change
	state files have been combined as a necessary step in
	implementing branches.

   Version 3.0 Major New Features
	* Aegis	now has	a feature known	in the literature as long
	transactions, also known as branches.  This allows
	appropriately created changes to be treated as if they
	were projects, and thus	to have	changes	made to	them.
	This allows a hierachy of changes within changes, to any
	desired	depth.	See the	Branching chapter of the Aegis
	User Guide for more information.

	* The project state files have been merged with	the
	change state files.  This is part of the implementation
	of branching.  If you have written your	own reports, you
	may need to alter them slightly.  For example, in version
	2.3 and	earlier, reports accessed the project state file
	using
		auto p,	ps;
		p = project[project_name()];
		ps = p.state;
	Because	the project state has been moved into a	change
	state, the state field above now points	at a change state
	description, and most of the old project information is
	contained in the branch	field within it.  Reports access
	this information as
		auto p,	ps;
		p = project[project_name()];
		ps = p.state.branch;
	Except for files, which	were already present in	the
	cstate,	so access to the project file list need	not
	change.	 See the new aecstate(5) for more information.

	* The new project command now creates branches to match

Reference Manual	      Aegis				9

Read Me(Aegis)					   Read	Me(Aegis)

	the version number specified.  See aenpr(1) for	more
	information.

	* The error messages of	Aegis have been
	internationalized.  This affects how you build Aegis, and
	the environment	Aegis runs in.	See the	BUILDING file for
	more information.  The cshrc and profile shipped with
	this release set the LANG environment variable to ``en''
	(for English) if you have not set it; otherwise	ther
	error messages would be	terse and uninformative.

	* The aet (1) command can now suggest tests to be run.
	This is	done by	correlating the	source files and test
	files from each	change.	 See aet(1) for	more information.

	* There	is now an aereport(1) command.	The separates out
	the report functionality from the main body of the Aegis
	code, allowing the report generator to be used in places
	where more trust is required.

	* There	is an intranet Web interface, which is installed
	automaticly when the install script discovers a	web
	server.	 This interface	allows browsing	of much	of the
	Aegis meta-data, of all	publicly accessible projects.

	* There	is now an aefind(1) command.  This is very
	similar	to the UNIX find(1) command, except that it finds
	in the unified directory stack of a change and its
	project.  The introduction of full branch support can
	sometimes mean that finding a file may require looking in
	more than two directories; the aefind(1) command makes
	this simple again.

   Version 3.0 Minor New Features
	* There	is now a -No_Pager option, to prevent listings
	and help from being redirected to a pager.  There is also
	a user preference to more thoroughly disable paging, and
	a -PAGer option	to override it.	 See aegis(1) and
	aeuconf(5) for more information.

	* There	is now a -No_PErsevere option to aet(1), allowing
	you to request that aet(1) stop	after the first	test
	failure.  There	is also	a user preference to set this
	permanently if desired,	and a -PErsever	option to
	override it.  See aet(1) and aeuconf(5)	for more
	information.

	* The copyright	years attribute	has been moved from being
	a project attribute to a change	attribute.  This is
	consistent with	a number of other fields which have
	transparently moved from the project state files into the
	change state files, as a result	of branching support.
	See aeca(1) and	aecattr(5) for more information.

Reference Manual	      Aegis			       10

Read Me(Aegis)					   Read	Me(Aegis)

	* There	is a new Search_Path substitution, to support
	builds on branches.  See aesub(5) for more information.
	As a side effect, you can also use it in the test_command
	field of the project config file, and thus have	a search
	path to	look down for data files for your tests.

	* Test times are now remembered, so that tests are only
	run if they need to be.	 This allows you to keep working
	on a test, and Aegis only runs those that have not yet
	passed.

	* Aegis	now uses ``fingerprints'' to tell if files have
	changed, rather	than simply relying on file modification
	time stamps.  While this makes Aegis more robust, there
	is one caveat: it is recommended that 3.0 be installed
	when there are no changes in the 'being	reviewed' or
	'awaiting integration' states, in any project.

	* There	is now a log file prefernces control, allowing
	users to set their preferred logging behaviour.	 See
	aeuconf(5) for more information.

	* It is	now possible to	specify	the filename for new
	tests on the command line.  See	aent(1)	for more
	information.

	* It is	not possible to	specify	a pattern for test
	filesnames.  See aepconf(5) for	more information.

	* There	is now a -MAXimum option to the	aeib command,
	allowing you to	keep obsolete derived files at integrate
	begin.	This can avoid long integration	build times for
	large projects.

   Version 3.0 Bug Fixes
	* Architecture names are now checked a `develop	end'
	time, to ensure	there are no unknown variants.	This
	fixes the mysterious ``you must	build again'' problem.

	* The aecp(1) and aed(1) commands now take a baseline
	read lock, to be more symetric with the	aeb(1) command
	which has always done so.  The aeip(1) command takes the
	complementary baseline write lock, ensuring the	the
	baseline remains constant for the duration of builds,
	file copies, differences and merges.  The manual entries
	for these commands have	all been improved to document
	this behaviour.	 See aeb(1), aecp(1), aed(1) and aeip(1)
	for more information.

	* There	are now	some reminder scripts in the library,
	which can be run from crontab(1).  These are installed
	into the /remind directory.  These scripts can be used to
	remind users of	changes	in various states, such	as those
	being developed	or being reviewed.

Reference Manual	      Aegis			       11

Read Me(Aegis)					   Read	Me(Aegis)

	* All of the commands which accept the -Edit option now
	also accept a -Edit_BackGround option, allowing	edit
	commands to be piped in	from the standard input.

	* The aecp(1) command now accepts a -INDependent option,
	allowing files to be copied independent	of any change
	(similar to the	-INDependent option of the command.)  See
	aecp(1)	for more information.

	* The aecp(1) command now accepts a -Read_Only option,
	allowing files to be copied into a change specifically to
	insulate it from baseline changes.  Such files must be
	uncopied before	development may	end.  See aecp(1) for
	more information.

	* The aenrls(1)	command	is now used only to convert
	pre-3.0	projects into post-3.0 projects.  This is because
	the full branching support in 3.0 makes	it more	useful to
	create a new release of	a project by ending development
	on the branch of the previous release and starting
	development of a new branch numbered for the new release.
	See the	Branching chapter of the User Guide for	more
	information.

   Version 2.3
	* The merging behaviour	of the aed(1) command has
	changed.  If any files require merging,	it only	merges.
	In this	way, merged files are not lost in the rest of the
	output.	 Also, there are now command line options and
	user preferences so that you can select	to only	merge or
	only difference.  See aed(1) and aeuconf(5) for	more
	nformation.

	* It is	now possible to	assign symbolic	names to project
	deltas.	 This means that you may now recreate earlier
	project	baselines by name.

	* All commands which accept a -Edit option now check for
	most errors before commencing the edit.	 This avoids
	wasted edits in	many error cases.

	* Fuzzy	file name matches are now used to improve the
	error messages from aecp, aerm,	etc.

	* Version number separators in project names are
	preserved across new releases.	Particularly, you can use
	a minus	('-') between the name and the major version
	number.

	* A new	``copyright_years'' project attribute has been
	added.	This is	a list of years	maintained at integrate
	begin time, to automate	the insertion of list of
	copyright years	into copyright messages	and
	documentation.	There is a new ${Copyright_Years}

	substitution and the copyright years are also listed in
	the ``aegis -list version'' listing.  See aesub(5) and
	ael(1) for more	information.

	* It is	now possible to	specify	patterns for acceptable
	and unacceptable filenames in the project config file.
	See aepconf(5) for more	information.

	* Four more functions have been	added to the report
	language: length, split, substr	and wrap.  See aer(5) for
	more information.

	* The tests distributed	with  are now more stable on very
	fast hosts.  See the environment variables section of
	aeb(1) for more	information.

	* The lib/config.example directory of the distribution
	now contains files with	example	portions of the	project
	config file.  May thanks to David R Shue
	<shue@ll.mit.edu> for this suggestion.

	Changes	made in	the previous release included:

   Version 2.2
	This release of	Aegis provides 3 of the	most commonly
	requested features: support for	heterogeneous
	development, support for a greater range of DMTs, support
	for user-defined reports.

	* Aegis	now supports heterogeneous development.	 Now you
	can be sure that your project not only always builds and
	tests sucessfully, but that it does so across a
	configurable set of system or hardware architectures.
	See the	Heterogeneous Development secion of the	Tips and
	Traps chapter of the User Guide	for more information.

	* Aegis	can now	cope with a wider range	of Dependency
	Maintenance Tools (DMTs).  It now has the ability to fill
	development directories	with symbolic links to all files
	in the baseline	which are not present in the development
	directory.  This allows	DMTs to	assume all files are
	present	below the current directory, allowing DMTs such
	as cake	and GNU	Make to	be used.  See the Dependency
	Maintenance Tool section of the	User Guide and aeb(1) for
	more information.

	* Aegis	now has	a report generator, so you can create
	your own reports.  Many	"canned" reports are included in
	this distribution; of particular interest to many will be
	the File_Activity report, which	details	currently active
	files.	See aer(1) for more information.

	* Aegis	is now configured using	a shell	script called
	configure, distributed with the	package.  This shell

Reference Manual	      Aegis			       13

	script is generated using GNU Autoconf.	 See the BUILDING
	file for more information.

	* The AEGIS environment	variable has been renamed
	AEGIS_PATH, to bring it	in line	with the AEGIS_PROJECT
	and AEGIS_CHANGE environment variable names.  The old
	name will keep working for some	time, but aegis	will warn
	you.

	* Filename lengths are now configurable.  The 14
	character portability limit is still the default, but a
	higher limit is	configurable for each project, up to the
	filesystem filename limit.  See	aepconf(5) for more
	information.

	* It is	now possible to	specify	that filenames must be
	within the minimum character set mandated by POSIX.  The
	default	is as before, to allow any printing character.
	See aepconf(5) for more	information.

	* Limits on the	length of project names	have been
	relaxed.  Project names	are now	only limited by	the
	filesystem filename limit.

	* It is	now possible to	specify	the command to run tests,
	allowing a project to use a specialized	test facility,
	rather than be forced to use shell scripts.  See aet(1)
	and for	more information.

	* The commands which accept the	-Edit now preserve the
	edited text in the event of a failure.

	* The commands which delete files now accept a
	-Interactive option, which causes them to prompt the user
	for confirmation of file deletion.  This can be	made the
	default	by an appropriate setting of the aliases or
	individual users preferences files.  See aenfu(1),
	aentu(1), aecpu(1), and	aeuconf(5) for more information.

	* The aecp(1) command now accepts directory names,
	allowing whole directory trees to be copied into a
	change.	 The aecpu(1) command now has a	-UNChanged option
	which allows the unchanged files to be uncopied.

	* The aeb command now accepts file names, allowing
	partial	builds to be performed.	 See aeb(1) for	more
	information.

	* There	is a new aechown(1) command to facilitate
	reassigning the	developer of a change which is in the
	being developed	state.

	* It is	now possible for project administrators	to assign
	changes	to specific developers.	 See aedb(1) for more

	information.

   Version 2.1
	* Can now ask for history to maintained	for file
	generated by the build.	 This is useful	for generating
	patch files.

   Version 2.0
	* A new	command	has been added to facilitate changing the
	name of	a file as part of a change.  See aemv(1) for more
	information.

	* It is	now possible to	list the locks currently held.
	See ael(1) for more information.

	* If no	other defaulting mechanism is specified, aegis
	will now attempt to guess the project name and change
	number from the	pathname of the	current	directory.  This
	only works from	within development directories.

	* The aenc, aeca, aerfail, aeifail and aepa commands now
	accept a -Edit command line argument.  See the relevant
	manual pages for more information.

	* The aenpr command now	understands the	-MAJor and -MINOr
	options, allowing the initial version of a project to be
	something other	than 1.0.

	* The aed command now understands the -ANticipate option.
	See aed(1) for more information.

	* It is	now possible to	list all the outstanding changes
	of a project, or of all	projects.  See ael(1) for more
	information.

   Version 1.4
	* Support has been added for systems without the seteuid
	system call, or	those with crippled implementations.

	* Most of the unimplemented command variants have been
	finished.  These include New Change Undo, Develop Begin
	Undo and ReMove	PRoject.  Most notable of the exceptions
	is -ANticipate option for the -CoPy_file and -DIFFerence
	command.

	* The User Guide has been added	to, making it a	little
	more complete.	It still needs more work, sigh.

	* The code to handle automounters has been made	more
	robust.

	* The command substitutions have been vastly improved,
	and are	now documented.
