DESCRIPTION
	The aegis program is a CASE tool with a	difference.  In
	the spirit of the UNIX Operating System, the aegis
	program	is a small component designed to work with other
	programs.

	Many CASE systems attempt to provide everything, from
	bubble charts to source	control	to compilers.  Users are
	trapped	with the components supplied by	the CASE system,
	and if you don't like one of the components (it	may be
	too limited, for instance), then that is just tough.

	In contrast, UNIX provides many	components of a	CASE
	system - compilers, editors, dependency	maintenance tools
	(such as make),	source control tools (such as RCS).  You
	may substitute the tool	of your	choice if you don't like
	the ones supplied with the system - gcc, jove, cake, to
	name just a few.  The aegis program adds to this list
	with software configuration management,	and true to UNIX
	philosophy, the	aegis program does not dictate the choice
	of any of the other tools (although it may stretch them
	to their limits).

	Enough hype, what is it	that the aegis program does?
	Just what is software configuration management?	 This
	question is sufficiently broad as to require a book in
	answer.	 In essence, the aegis program is a project
	change supervisor.  It provides	a framework within which
	a team of developers may work on many changes to a
	program	independently, and the aegis program coordinates
	integrating these changes back into the	master source of
	the program, with as little disruption as possible.
	Resolution of contention for source files, a major
	headache for any project with more than	one developer, is
	one of the aegis program's major functions.

	It should be noted that	the aegis program is a
	developer's tool, in the same sense as make or RCS are
	developer's tools.  It is not a	manager's tool - it does
	not provide progress tracking or manage	work allocation.

BENEFITS
	So why should you use the aegis	program?

	The aegis program uses a particular model of the
	development of software	projects.  This	model has a
	master source (or baseline) of a project, and a	team of
	developers creating changes to be made to this baseline.
	When a change is complete, it is integrated with the
	baseline, to become the	new baseline.  Each change must
	be atomic and self-contained, no change	is allowed to
	cause the baseline to cease to work.  "Working"	is
	defined	as passing it's	own tests.  The	tests are
	considered part	of the baseline.  The aegis program
	provides support for the developer so that an entire copy
	of the baseline	need not be taken to change a few files,
	only those files which are to be changed need to be
	copied.

	In order to ensure that	changes	are unable to cause the
	baseline to cease to work, aegis mandates that changes be
	accompanied by at least	one test, and that all such tests
	be known to complete successfully.  These steadily
	accumulated tests form an ever increasing regression test
	suite for all later changes.  There is also a mandatory
	review stage for each change to	the baseline.  While
	these requirements may be relaxed per-change or	even per-
	project, doing so potentially compromises the "working"
	definition of the baseline.

	The win	in using the aegis program is that there are O(n)
	interactions between developers	and the	baseline.
	Contrast this with a master source which is being edited
	directly by the	developers - there are O(n!)
	interactions between developers	- this makes adding "just
	one more" developer a potential	disaster.

	Another	win is that the	project	baseline always	works.
	Always having a	working	baseline means that a version is
	always available for demonstrations, or	those "pre-
	release	snapshots" we are always forced	to provide.

	The above advantages are all very well - for management
	types.	Why should Joe Average Programmer use the aegis
	program?  Recall that RCS provides file	locking, but only
	for one	file at	a time.	 The aegis program provides the
	file locking, atomically, for the set of files in the
	change.	 Recall	also that RCS locks the	file the instant
	you start editing it.  This makes popular files	a project
	bottleneck.  The aegis program allows concurrent editing,
	and a resolution mechanism just	before the change must be
	integrated, meaning fewer delays for J.A.Programmer.

ARCHIVE	SITE
	The latest version of aegis is available by anonymous FTP
	from:
	    Host:   ftp.cse.nau.edu (134.114.64.70)
	    Dir:    /pub/Aegis
	    File:   aegis.2.1.tar.Z	# the complete source
	    File:   aegis.2.1.patch.Z	# patch	to take	2.0 to 2.1
	    File:   aegis.2.1.ps.Z	# PostScript of	the User Guide

	To use anonymous FTP, give "anonymous" as the user name
	(omit the quotes) and your email address as the	password.

	My grateful thanks to Paul Balyoz <pab@ftp.cse.nau.edu>
	for his	generosity in providing	this archive space.

	This directory also contains a few other pieces	of
	software written by me.	 Some are referred to in the
	aegis documentation.  Please have a look if you	are
	interested.

	For those of you without FTP, I	recommend the use of an
	ftp-by-email server.  Here is a	list of	a few (there are
	many more):
		ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com
		ftpmail@cs.uow.edu.au

	In general, you	can get	a help message about how to use
	each system by sending email with a subject of "help" and
	a message body containing just the word	"help".

MAILING	LIST
	A mailing list has been	created	so that	users of aegis
	may exchange ideas about how to	use the	aegis program.
	Discussion may include,	but is not limited to: bugs,
	enhancements, and applications.	 The list is not
	moderated.

	The address of the mailing list	is
		aegis-users@bmr.gov.au

	To subscribe to	this mailing list, send	an email message
	to majordomo@bmr.gov.au	with a message body containing
	the single line
		subscribe aegis-users
	Please note that bmr.gov.au is an Internet site, so if
	you have an address which is not readily derived from
	your mail headers (majordomo is	only a Perl program,
	after all) you will need to use	a message of the form:
		subscribe aegis-users address
	where address is an email address which	makes sense from
	an Internet site.

	The software which handles this	mailing	list CANNOT send
	you a copy of the aegis	program.  Please use FTP or ftp-

	by-email, instead.

COMPARISON WITH	CVS
	One of the most	common questions about aegis is	"How does
	it compare with	CVS?"

	The CVS	program	aims to	provide	a repository, RCS for
	sets of	files.	The aegis program aims to provide a
	baseline, a repository,	consistency of the baseline, and
	validation of changes being made to the	baseline.

	A simplistic way of thinking of	this is	"CVS is	over
	RCS", but "aegis is over RCS and make".	 Actually CVS
	requires RCS, whereas aegis may	be configured to use
	almost any history tool; similarly for the dependency
	maintenance tool, aegis	may be configured to use almost
	any sufficiently capable tool (unfortunately traditional
	make isn't sufficiently	capable, but the name is well
	known and evokes the appropriate functional image).

	The most significant point of departure	is around the
	"cvs checkin" functionality.  In CVS, this is
	unconditional; a developer can add a poorly though-out
	code change, or	even indulge in	a little vandalism, with
	nothing	to prevent it.	In contrast, the aegis program
	breaks this step into several pieces: the change must be
	be known to build, the change must have	tests and those
	tests be known to have run and passed, the change must
	then be	reviewed (double check), and then built	and
	tested again (triple check).

	For a more detailed discussion,	see appendix C of the
	User Guide.

NEW IN THIS RELEASE
	A number of features have been added to	aegis with this
	release.  A few	of them	are detailed here:

	* Can now ask for history to maintained	for file
	generated by the build.	 This is useful	for generating
	patch files.


	Plus the usual crop of bug fixes and tinkering.	 For
	excruciating detail, and also acknowledgements of those
	who generously sent me feedback, please	see the	CHANGES
	file included in this distribution.

BUILDING
	Instructions on	how to build and test the aegis	program
	are to be found	in the BUILDING	file included in this
	distribution.

SOME HISTORY
	The idea for aegis did not come	full-blown into	my head
	in the shower, as some of my programs do, but rather from
	working	in a software shop which used a	simplistic form
	of something similar.  That system was held together by
	chewing-gum and	string,	it was written in a disgusting
	variant	of Basic, and by golly the damn	thing worked
	(mostly).  The aegis program is	nothing	like it, owes
	none of	its code to that system, and is	far more
	versatile.

	Since that company decided to close down our section, we
	all moved on simultaneously (all 60 of us), sometimes
	working	together, and sometimes	not, but always	keeping
	in touch.  With	suggestions and	conversations with some
	of them	early in 1990, the manual entries for aegis took
	shape, and formed most of the design document for aegis.

	Since getting the first	glimmerings of a functional aegis
	late in	1990 it	is increasingly	obvious	that I never want
	to be without it ever again.  All of my	sources	that I
	modify are instantly placed under aegis, as is anything	I
	distribute.  All code I	write for myself, and all new
	code I write for my employer, goes under aegis.	 Why?
	Because	it has fewer bugs!

	Example: one of	the sources I carry with me from job to
	job is "cook", my dependency maintenance tool.	Cook had
	existed	for 3 years before aegis appeared on the scene,
	and I used it daily.  When I placed cook under aegis, I
	found 6	bugs!  Since then I have found a few more.  Not
	only are there now fewer bugs, but they	never come back,
	because	the regression test suite always grows.
