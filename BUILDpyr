PYRAMID
	This file describes how	to configure aegis to be compiled
	on the Pyramid SMP DC/OSx 1.0-92b023 operating system.

	1.  Copy the conf/dcosx	file to	the common/conf.h file.
	    This sets most of the compile-time configuations.

	2.  There is a bug in the <sys/types.h>	include	file.
	    Make a copy	and replace the	string "enum boolean"
	    with "enum boolean_t".  There is only one.	The ANSI
	    C and POSIX	rules say that they should have	used a _t
	    suffix or an underscore (_)	prefix.	 Complain to your
	    vendor.
	    % mkdir common/sys
	    % cp /usr/include/sys/types.h common/sys/stypes.h
	    % vi common/sys/types.h
	    ...edit the	file...
	    %

	3.  Edit the Makefile file and select the alternatives
	    marked "dcosx".  The horrible CC and CFLAGS	macros
	    are	because	the C compiler is brain-dead.  You will
	    get	a huge number of warnings when you compile aegis,
	    just ignore	them.  You may want to consider	getting
	    gcc	instead.

	4.  Once you have obtained gcc,	edit the Makefile and
	    select the gcc alternatives	for the	CC and CFLAGS
	    macros.
