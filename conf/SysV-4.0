 * This defines the file creation mask.  See umask(2) for more information.
 * Some bits are not available, because aegis is _meant_ to be paranoid.
 * Owner: always has read, write and search/exec.
 * Group: always has read and search/exec, so that developers can get at the
 *	baseline.  There is never group write, because then developers
 *	could trash the baseline, which is counter-productive.
 * Others: There is never others write, for the same reason as group.
 *	Others read and search/execute is configurable.
 *
 * The permissions mask in binary looks like
 *	000 010 X1X
 * where the Xs may be configured.
 *
 * Alternatives for default umask are thus
 *	027	others get nothing
 *	026	others can execute the results if they know where they are going
 *	022	others can see and copy and execute anything
 *	023	don't do this (why is left as an exersize for the reader)
 *
 * Projects have a configurable umask, this is just the default.
 *	See aepattr(1) for more information.
