Project "aegis.3.15", Change 16					 Page 1
Change Details				       Tue Jun 15 12:49:47 1999

NAME
	Project "aegis.3.15", Delta 5, Change 16.

SUMMARY
	debug link hassle

DESCRIPTION
	Compiling Aegis-3.15 fails due to linking errors (unresolved
	symbol references) if compiled with egcs-1.1.1 (aka gcc-2.91)
	using debugging option '-g' and *NO* optimization (no -Ox
	options). For example, set 'CFLAGS=-g' in the Makefile.
	Typical unresolved symbols are 'input_getc', 'input_name',
	'output_filename', 'output_fputc'. I expect the same problem
	with other GCC versions which provide for inlining of C-
	functions (gcc-2.8.1).

	My thanks to Leo Razoumov  <lrazoumov@qualcomm.com> for
	reporting this problem.

	This change is exempt from testing against the development
	directory.  This change is exempt from testing against the
	baseline.
