So that you can begin to use Aegis rapidly,
there are some example projects available.

This template project uses GNU Make for its build tool,
and RCS as its history tool.

</td><td valign=top>
This template project uses
.br
<a href="http://www.canb.auug.org.au/~millerp/cook/">Cook</a> for its
build tool, and
.br
<a href="http://www.canb.auug.org.au/~millerp/fhist.html">FHist</a>
as its history tool.
It scales better than the Make-RCS example.

<p>
These template projects provided a simple but flexible skeleton around
which you can build many different projects.  Each project links you to
a page of instructions for how to download the change set and apply it.
