Here is a quick list of the key features of Aegis:
<br clear=all>
<ul>
<li>
All operations on the repository are based on change sets.
<li>
True configurations.  All changes are reproducable snapshots.  Every
change set has a unique configuration identifier.
<li>
Ability to rename files without losing their history.
<li>
Binary files are supported.
<li>
File meta-data are versioned.  Aegis versions not only file contents and
file existence, but also the `execute' permission flag on files and file
attributes.  Users can attach arbitrary meta-data ("attributes") to any
file.
<li>
Commits are truly atomic.  No part of a commit takes effect until the
entire commit has succeeded.  Log messages are attached to the revision,
not stored redundantly as in CVS.
<li>
Access controls on lines of development (branches).
Creating a branch in Aegis can be accomplished with a single, fast command.
.\" <li>
.\" End-to-end integrity controls. If a server has a bad file, or a
.\" replicating server actively attempts to replace the proper content,
.\" the end user can detect the error or substitution.
<li>
Repository synchronization, geographically distributed development.
<li>
Optimal performance for all users, local or remote, beuase there isn't
any difference.  Repository syncgronization means all developers, local
or remote, get optimal performance.
<li>
Disconnected commits.  Have you ever screwed up a code base on an
airplane or a vacation and wished you could back out?  Productivity
while traveling, at home, at remote offices with partial or slow network
connectivity.
<li>
Peer-to-peer architecture.  Work may flow in any direction, including
"sideways" between two sites without involving a master site.
<li>
Costs are proportional to change size, not data size.  In general, the
time required for an Aegis operation is proportional to the size of the
<i>changes</i> resulting from that operation, not to the absolute size
of the project in which the changes are taking place.
<li>
Aegis uses a collection of very simple on-disk formats for archives
and ancillary databases.  It does not require or use a relational
database, hash-table database, or anything else that requires acolytes
and administrators.  Consequently, creating a new project repository is
utterly trivial: a single Aegis command does it, basically by creating
some new directories.
</ul>
