NAME

	directory.  This change is exempt from testing against the
	baseline.


ARCHITECTURE
	This change must build and test in the "linux-i486"
	architecture.

NAME

SUMMARY
	correct web interface

DESCRIPTION
	This change corrects the change list web page, which was giving
	the wrong developer name for some changes.

	"When a change has had a review_fail, the change is in being_
	developed state, and thus the report should list the developer
	of that change. It displays the last person in the history list
	however, which is the reviewer (and not the developer).	 I
	suspect this also happens when a change has received an
	integrate_fail (although I did not verify this)"

	My thanks to Steef de Bruijn <S.de.Bruijn@Integrity.NL> for
	reporting this problem.

	This change is exempt from testing against the development
	directory.  This change is exempt from testing against the
	baseline.
