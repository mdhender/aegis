SUMMARY
	symlink exception patterns

DESCRIPTION
	There are two config entries: symlink_exceptions and integrate_
	begin_exceptions.  integrate_begin_exceptions allows patterns.
	symlink_exceptions does not allow patterns.  Even so, you
	specify patterns in the sample project.	 I will try changing
	the str_equal to a gmatch (and swapping the arguments) in the
	build symlink routine.

	My thanks to David Brown <davidb@qualcomm.com> for reporting
	this problem.

	directory.  This change is exempt from testing against the
