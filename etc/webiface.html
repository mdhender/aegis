<center>Aegis \*(v)<br>Web Interface</center></h1>
Aegis has a read-only web interface to its database.  The page uses Aegis'
own web interface to look at Aegis' own development (because Aegis is
developed using Aegis).  If you have Apache installed when Aegis is
configured and built, this interface (to your projects, not this one)
will be installed for you at your site, too.
.br
<p>
The <a
.br
href="/cgi-bin/aegis.cgi?">
top-level view</a>
is of all projects being managed by Aegis.
You can drill down to everything else from this point.
.br
<p>
The <a
.br
href="/cgi-bin/aegis.cgi?file@proj_menu+project@aegis.\*(v)">
project</a> page.  Every project (and each branch) has one.  In this
case you will be taken to the one for Aegis \*(v).
.br
<p>
The <a
.br
href="/cgi-bin/aegis.cgi?file@proj_hstry+project@aegis.\*(v)">
completed changes</a>
page lists all of the completed changes to date (on the development branch).
This is the bleeding edge.
The <i>Download</i> links are only of interest to Aegis developers, but
they demonstrate <i>how</i> an Internet project (or a global VPN project)
could distribute change sets.  Click on the change number for more
information about each change.

<h2 align=center> SourceForge Hack </h2>
.br
Using the Aegis web interface on SourceForge is a little different than
at your own site, due to the chroot jail that is used.  (Change these
instructions to suit the name of your project.)  You wont be able to
compile on SourceForge, so on a linux PC elsewhere
<ol>
<li>
Configure with <i>./configure --prefix=/home/groups/a/ae/aegis</i>
<li>
Edit the generated Makefile, and add -DSOURCE_FORGE_HACK to the CFLAGS
variable.
<li>
Edit the generated Makefile, and set ScriptRoot to ${prefix}/cgi-bin
<li>
Now you can <i>make</i> as normal.
<li>
You can use the RPM_BUILD_ROOT setting of the Makefile, or you can
<i>mkdir -p /home/groups/a/ae/aegis/cgi-bin</i>
<li>
When you <i>make install</i>, you will then need to cull the install
tree of unneccessary files.  You only need <i>cgi-bin/aegis.cgi</i>,
<i>bin/aegis</i>, <i>bin/aedist</i>, <i>bin/aepatch</i>,
<i>bin/aereport</i>, <i>bin/aerect</i> <i>bin/ae_diff2htm</i>,
and the <i>share/en/html</i> tree.
The rest can be removed.
<li>
Make a tarball, <i>scp</i> it to SourceForge, unpack at the other end.
<li>
Now upload your project.  I use <i>rsync</i> for efficient differential
uploads.  The directory needs to be inside the chroot jail, but outside
the <i>htdocs</i> directory.  You need the whole project tree.
<li>
Edit <i>/home/groups/a/ae/aegis/com/state</i>
to point at the project tree.
</ol>
If this takes off, I'll ask the SourceForge people to install it, so
that this is much less necessary.
