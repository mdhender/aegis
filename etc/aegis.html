Aegis is a transaction-based software configuration management system.
It provides a framework within which
a team of developers may work on many changes to a
program independently, and Aegis coordinates integrating
these changes back into the master source of the program,
with as little disruption as possible.

Aegis supports large teams and large projects.

Aegis supports change sets.
</ul></td><td valign=top rowspan=3><ul><li>
Aegis enforces a development process which requires that change sets
``work'' before they may be integrated into the project baseline.
<i>Works</i> includes requiring that change sets build successfully, and
(optionally) that they include <i>and pass</i> tests.  It also ensures
that code reviews have been performed.
</ul></td></tr>

.br

Aegis is designed around incremental development.  It records these
increments as file change sets, and can reproduce any historical
increment.

Aegis is designed for repository security
(availability, integrity and confidentiality).

Aegis supports distributed repositories.
</ul></td><td valign=top rowspan=2><ul><li>
Aegis supports both push and pull distribution models, and many
distribution topologies.  Aegis' normal development process is used to
validate received transactions before accepting them.

Aegis supports long transactions, also known as ``branches'' or ``lines
of development''.  This allows appropriately created changes to be
treated as if they were projects, and thus to have changes made to them.
This allows a hierarchy of changes within changes, to any desired depth.

Year 2000 Status
</center></h2>
Aegis does not suffer from Year 2000 problems.
<ul>
<li>
Aegis stores dates internally in Unix style (<i>i.e.</i> seconds
offset), so internal storage of times and dates does not suffer from
any Y2K problems.
<li>
Aegis always uses the ANSI C standard <tt>strftime</tt> function to display
times and dates.  (This assumes that your vendor has supplied a compliant
<tt>strftime</tt>.)  This means that displaying dates does not assume
fixed field widths, nor will it display the year 2000 as ``100''.
<li>
When a user enters dates, they may specify years with an explicit century.
If a user enters a year with an implicit century, the closest is assumed.

Aegis and Windows NT
</h2>
Aegis depends on the underlying security provided by the operating
system (rather than re-invent yet another security mechanism).
However, in order to do this, Aegis uses the POSIX <i>seteuid</i> system
call, which has no direct equivalent on Windows NT.  This makes
porting difficult.  Single-user ports are possible (<i>e.g.</i> using
<a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/">
Cygwin</a>), but are not
usually what folks want.
<p>
Compounding this is the fact that many sites want to develop their
software for both Unix and Windows NT simultaneously.  This means that
the security of the repository needs to be guaranteed to be handled
in the same way by both operating systems, otherwise one can act as a
``back door'' into the repository.  Many sites do not have the same
users and permissions (sourced from the same network register of users)
on both Unix and Windows NT, making the mapping almost impossible even
if the security models did actually correspond.
<p>
Most sites using Aegis and Windows NT together do so by running 
Aegis on the Unix systems, but building and testing on the NT
systems.  The work areas and repository are accessed via Samba or
NFS.
