Aegis is a transaction-based software configuration management system.
It provides a framework within which
a team of developers may work on many changes to a
program independently, and Aegis coordinates integrating
these changes back into the master source of the program,
with as little disruption as possible.
.br
<ul><li>
Aegis is designed around incremental development.  It records these
increments and file change sets, and can reproduce any historical
increment.
.br
<li>
Aegis enforces a development process which requires that change
sets ``work'' before they may be integrated into the project baseline.
Works includes requiring that change sets build successfully, and
(optionally) that they include <i>and pass</i> tests.
It also ensures that code reviews have been performed.
.br
<li>
Aegis has strong support for geographically distributed development.
It supports both push and pull models, and many distribution topologies.
Aegis' normal development process is used to validate received change
sets before committing them.
.br
<li>
Aegis supports long transactions, also known as branches or lines of
development.  This allows appropriately created changes to be treated as
if they were projects, and thus to have changes made to them.  This allows
a hierarchy of changes within changes, to any desired depth.
.br
<li>
The error messages of Aegis have been internationalized.  This means
that error messages can be in your native language, if a translation has
been provided.  (So far, only English is provided.  Translations welcome.)
.br
<li>
There is a script-based reporting facility, allowing many custom reports
to be generated from the Aegis database.  There are also many report
scripts distributed with Aegis.
.br
<li>
There is an intranet Web interface, which is installed automatically when
the install script discovers a web server.  This interface allows browsing
of much of the Aegis meta-data, of all publicly accessible projects.
</ul>
.br
<p>
Aegis runs on almost any flavor of UNIX.
Self configuring using a script generated by GNU Autoconf.

See the
<a href="aegis-\*(v).README"><tt>README</tt></a>
file for a description of the new features and bug-fixes in this release.
This is also in the
<a href="aegis-\*(v).rm.ps.gz">Aegis Reference Manual</a>,
along with the build and installation instructions, and all of the
manual pages.
<hr><h2><center>
Year 2000 Status
</center></h2>
Aegis does not suffer from Year 2000 problems.
<ul>
<li>
Aegis stores dates internally in Unix style (<i>i.e.</i> seconds
offset), so internal storage of times and dates does not suffer from
any Y2K problems.
<li>
Aegis always uses the ANSI C standard <tt>strftime</tt> function to display
times and dates.  (This assumes that your vendor has supplied a compliant
<tt>strftime</tt>.)  This means that displaying dates does not assume
fixed field widths, nor will it display the year 2000 as ``100''.
<li>
When a user enters dates, they may specify years with an explicit century.
If a user enters a year with an implicit century, the closest is assumed.
</ul>

Template Projects

So that you can begin to use Aegis rapidly,
there are some example projects available.

<a href="example-make-rcs.html"><tt>example-make-rcs</tt></a>

and RCS as its history tool.

</td><td valign=top>
This template project uses <a href="../cook.html">Cook</a> for its
build tool, and <a href="../fhist.html">FHist</a> as its history tool.
It scales better than the Make-RCS example.
</td></tr>

These template projects provided a simple but flexible skeleton around
which you can build many different projects.  Each project links you to
a page of instructions for how to download the change set and apply it.

Aegis and Windows NT
</h2>
Aegis depends on the underlying security provided by the operating
system (rather than re-invent yet another security mechanism).
However, in order to do this, Aegis uses the POSIX <i>seteuid</i> system
call, which has no direct equivalent on Windows NT.  This makes
porting difficult.  Single-user ports are possible (<i>e.g.</i> using
<a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/">
Cygwin</a>), but are not
usually what folks want.
<p>
Compounding this is the fact that many sites want to develop their
software for both Unix and Windows NT simultaneously.  This means that
the security of the repository needs to be guaranteed to be handled
in the same way by both operating systems, otherwise one can act as a
``back door'' into the repository.  Many sites do not have the same
users and permissions (sourced from the same network register of users)
on both Unix and Windows NT, making the mapping almost impossible even
if the security models did actually correspond.
<p>
Most sites using Aegis and Windows NT together do so by running 
Aegis on the Unix systems, but building and testing on the NT
systems.  The work areas and repository are accessed via Samba or
NFS.
