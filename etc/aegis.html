Aegis is a transaction-based software configuration management system.
It provides a framework within which
a team of developers may work on many changes to a
program independently, and Aegis coordinates integrating
these changes back into the master source of the program,
with as little disruption as possible.
.br
<ul><li>
Aegis is designed around incremental development.  It records these
increments and file change sets, and can reproduce any historical
increment.
.br
<li>
Aegis enforces a development process which requires that change
sets ``work'' before they may be integrated into the project baseline.
Works includes requiring that change sets build successfully, and
(optionally) that they include <i>and pass</i> tests.
It also ensures that code reviews have been performed.
.br
<li>
Aegis supports long transactions, also known as branches.  This allows
appropriately created changes to be treated as if they were projects,
and thus to have changes made to them.  This allows a hierarchy of changes
within changes, to any desired depth.
.br
<li>
The error messages of Aegis have been internationalized.  This means
that error messages can be in your native language, if a translation has
been provided.  (So far, only English is provided.  Translations welcome.)
.br
<li>
There is a script-based reporting facility, allowing many custom reports
to be generated from the Aegis database.  There are also many report
scripts distributed with Aegis.
.br
<li>
There is an intranet Web interface, which is installed automaticly when
the install script discovers a web server.  This interface allows browsing
of much of the Aegis meta-data, of all publicly accessible projects.
</ul>
.br
<p>
Aegis runs on almost any flavor of UNIX.
Self configuring using a script generated by GNU Autoconf.

See the
<a href="aegis-\*(v).README"><tt>README</tt></a>
file for a description of the new features and bug-fixes in this release.
This is also in the
<a href="aegis-\*(v).rm.ps.gz">Aegis Reference Manual</a>,
along with the build and installation instructions, and all of the
manual pages.
<hr><h2><center>
Year 2000 Status
</center></h2>
Aegis does not suffer from Year 2000 problems.
<ul>
<li>
Aegis stores dates internally in Unix style (<i>i.e.</i> seconds
offset), so internal storage of times and dates does not suffer from
any Y2K problems.
<li>
Aegis always uses the ANSI C standard <tt>strftime</tt> function to display
times and dates.  (This assumes that your vendor has supplied a compliant
<tt>strftime</tt>.)  This means that displaying dates does not assume
fixed field widths, nor will it display the year 2000 as ``100''.
<li>
When a user enters dates, they may specify years with an explict century.
If a user enters a year with an implicit century, the closest is assumed.
</ul>
