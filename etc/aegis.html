Aegis is a transaction-based software configuration management system.
It provides a framework within which
a team of developers may work on many changes to a
program independently, and Aegis coordinates integrating
these changes back into the master source of the program,
with as little disruption as possible.

Aegis supports large teams and large projects.
</ul></td><td valign=top width="50%"><ul><li>
Each project is a separate repository, with separately configurable
policies.
</ul></td></tr>

.br
<tr><td valign=top width="50%"><ul><li>
Aegis supports change sets.
</ul></td><td valign=top rowspan=3><ul><li>
Aegis enforces a development process which requires that change sets
``work'' before they may be integrated into the project baseline.
<i>Works</i> includes requiring that change sets build successfully, and
(optionally) that they include <i>and pass</i> tests.  It also ensures
that code reviews have been performed.
</ul></td></tr>

.br
<tr><td valign=top width="50%"><ul><li>
Aegis is designed around incremental development.  It records these
increments as file change sets, and can reproduce any historical
increment.
</ul></td></tr>

.br
<tr><td valign=top width="50%"><ul><li>
Aegis is designed for repository security
(availability, integrity and confidentiality).
</ul></td></tr>

.br
<tr><td valign=top width="50%"><ul><li>
Aegis supports distributed repositories.
</ul></td><td valign=top rowspan=2><ul><li>
Aegis supports both push and pull distribution models, and many
distribution topologies.  Aegis' normal development process is used to
validate received transactions before accepting them.
</ul></td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top width="50%"><ul><li>
Aegis supports multiple repositories.
</ul></td></tr>

.br
<tr><td valign=top width="50%"><ul><li>
Aegis supports multiple lines of development.
</ul></td><td valign=top rowspan=3><ul><li>
Aegis supports long transactions, also known as ``branches'' or ``lines
of development''.  This allows appropriately created changes to be
treated as if they were projects, and thus to have changes made to them.
This allows a hierarchy of changes within changes, to any desired depth.
</ul></td></tr>

.br
<tr><td valign=top width="50%"><ul><li>
Aegis supports multiple simultaneous active branches.

Aegis is mature software - it was first released in 1991.

The error messages of Aegis have been
<a href="translate.html">internationalized</a>.  This means
that error messages can be in your native language, if a translation has
been provided.
More translations are welcome.

Aegis now has users all around the world.

Aegis is easy to use.
It <i>is</i> big, it <i>does</i> have a lot of functionality,
but the essential process can be learned in less than a day.

The Aegis development model is very versatile.
It is suitable for a huge range of projects and teams.
</ul></td></tr>

.br
<tr><td valign=top width="50%"><ul><li>
There is a script-based reporting facility, allowing many custom reports
to be generated from the Aegis database.  There are also many report
scripts distributed with Aegis.
</ul></td><td valign=top width="50%"><ul><li>
There is an intranet <a href="webiface.html">Web interface</a>, which is
installed automatically when the install script discovers a web server.
This interface allows browsing of much of the Aegis meta-data, of all
publicly accessible projects.

Aegis runs on almost any flavor of UNIX.
