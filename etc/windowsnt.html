Aegis depends on the underlying security provided by the operating
system (rather than re-invent yet another security mechanism).
However, in order to do this, Aegis uses the POSIX <i>seteuid</i> system
call, which has no direct equivalent on Windows NT.  This makes
porting difficult.  Single-user ports are possible (<i>e.g.</i> using
<a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/">
Cygwin</a>), but are not
usually what folks want.
<p>
Compounding this is the fact that many sites want to develop their
software for both Unix and Windows NT simultaneously.  This means that
the security of the repository needs to be guaranteed to be handled
in the same way by both operating systems, otherwise one can act as a
``back door'' into the repository.  Many sites do not have the same
users and permissions (sourced from the same network register of users)
on both Unix and Windows NT, making the mapping almost impossible even
if the security models did actually correspond.
<p>
Most sites using Aegis and Windows NT together do so by running
Aegis on the Unix systems, but building and testing on the NT
systems.  The work areas and repository are accessed via Samba or
NFS.
