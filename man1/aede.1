.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I \*(n)
.I -Develop_End
command is used to
notify \*(n) of the completion of the development of a change.
.PP
This command checks that you have successfully completed
an '\*(n) -Build' command since any change source file was edited.
See
.IR aeb (1)
for more information.
.PP
This command checks that you have successfully completed
an '\*(n) -DIFFerence' command since any change source file was edited.
See
.IR aed (1)
for more information.
.PP
This command checks that you have successfully completed
an '\*(n) -Test' command
since the last successful build,
unless the change has a
.I test_exempt
attribute.
This command checks that you have successfully completed
an '\*(n) -Test -BaseLine' command,
unless the change has a
.I test_baseline_exempt
attribute.
This command checks that you have successfully completed
an '\*(n) -Test -REGression' command,
unless the change has a
.I test_regression_exempt
attribute.
See
.IR aet (1)
and
.IR aecattr (5)
for more information.
.PP
If the change includes the project
.I config
file,
this command checks project file names,
to make sure they conform to the
.I maximum_filename_length
and
.I posix_filename_charset
field settings.
See
.IR aepconf (5)
for more information.
.PP
Successful execution of the command advances the change
from the
.I "being developed"
state to the
.I "being reviewed"
state.
.PP
The ownership of files in the development directory
is changed to the project owner and group,
and the files changed to be read-only.
This prevents accidental alterations of the change's files
between development and integration.
.PP
The change is no longer considered assigned to the current user.
