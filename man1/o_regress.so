.\" MANIFEST: description of -REGression command line option
.\"
.TP 8n
.B -REGression
This option is used to specify that the
regression test suite is to be run.
The regression test suite consists of all
tests in the baseline which do not appear in the change.
It is an error if there are no regression tests.
You may not name tests on the command line
when using the -REGression option.
You may name individual tests to be run on the command line,
without using the -REGression option;
if they are not part of the change,
the tests of the same name in the baseline will be run.
