.\" MANIFEST: description of how file names are interpreted on command line
.\"
.PP
The \*(n) program will attempt to determine the project file names
from the file names given on the command line.
All file names are stored within \*(n) projects as relative to
the root of the baseline directory tree.
The development directory and the integration directory are shadows of
this baseline directory, and so these relative names apply here, too.
Files named on the command line 
are first converted to absolute paths if necessary.
They are then compared with the baseline path,
the development directory path,
and the integration directory path,
to determine a baseline-relative name.
It is an error if the file named is outside one of these directory trees.
