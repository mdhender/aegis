This option may be used to
specify a directory to be searched for global state files and
user state files.

Several library options may be present on the command line,
and are search in the order given.
Appended to this explicit search path are the directories specified
by the
.I AEGIS_PATH
environment variable (colon separated),
and finally,

All paths specified,
