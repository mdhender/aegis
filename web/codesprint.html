LCA 2009 Code Sprint </h1>
There will be an Aegis Code Sprint at LCA 2009.  We will attempt to
secure a room for a day or two, but there is always the very will
connected common room.
<p>
If you are an Aegis developer, or want to be an Aegis developer, join
us as we march south together at <a href="http://linux.conf.au/" >LCA
2009</a>, and crank out features to scratch your itch.
