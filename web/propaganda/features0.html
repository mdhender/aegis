Aegis \*(v)<br/>
A Condensed Feature List
</h1>
Aegis is a transaction-based software configuration management system.
It provides a framework within which
a team of developers may work on many changes to a
program independently, and Aegis coordinates integrating
these changes back into the master source of the program,
with as little disruption as possible.

Aegis supports large teams and large projects.
</ul></td><td valign=top width="50%"><ul><li>
Each project is a separate repository, with separately configurable
policies.
</ul></td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top width="50%"><ul><li>
Aegis supports change sets and atomic commits.
</ul></td><td valign=top rowspan=3><ul><li>
Aegis support a development process which ensures that change sets
wont stop the project &ldquo;working&rdquo; when they are integrated
into the project baseline.
<i>Working</i> includes requiring that change sets build successfully, and
(optionally) that they include <i>and pass</i> tests.  It can also support
code reviews of change sets, in a variety of styles.
</ul></td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top width="50%"><ul><li>
Aegis is designed around incremental development.  It records these
increments as file change sets, and can reproduce any historical
increment.
</ul></td></tr>

Aegis is designed for repository security
(availability, integrity and confidentiality).

<tr><td valign=top width="50%"><ul><li>
Aegis supports distributed repositories.
</ul></td><td valign=top rowspan=2><ul><li>
Aegis supports both push and pull distribution models, and many
distribution topologies.  Aegis' normal development process is used to
validate received transactions before accepting them.

Aegis supports multiple repositories.

Aegis supports multiple lines of development.
</ul></td><td valign=top rowspan=3><ul><li>
Aegis supports long transactions, also known as &ldquo;branches&rdquo;
or &ldquo;lines of development&rdquo;.  This allows appropriately
created changes to be treated as if they were projects, and thus to
have changes made to them.  This allows a hierarchy of changes within
changes, to any desired depth.
</ul></td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top width="50%"><ul><li>
Aegis supports multiple simultaneous active branches.

<tr><td valign=top width="50%"><ul><li>
Aegis supports branching to any depth.

Aegis is mature software - it was first released in 1991.
</ul></td><td valign=top rowspan=3><ul><li>
The error messages of Aegis have been
<a href="translate.html">internationalized</a>.  This means
that error messages can be in your native language, if a translation has
been provided.
More translations are welcome.

Aegis is easy to use.
It <i>is</i> big, it <i>does</i> have a lot of functionality,
but the essential process can be learned in less than a day.

The Aegis development model is very versatile.
It is suitable for a huge range of projects and teams.
</ul></td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top width="50%"><ul><li>
There is a script-based reporting facility, allowing many custom reports
to be generated from the Aegis database.  There are also many report
scripts distributed with Aegis.
</ul></td><td valign=top width="50%"><ul><li>
There is an intranet <a href="webiface.html">Web interface</a>, which is
installed automatically when the install script discovers a web server.
This interface allows browsing of much of the Aegis meta-data, of all
publicly accessible projects.
