<h2>Introduction</h2>
Even if you're not involved in a startup, these best practices for
running a small organization on a tight budget may help you critique
your own organization.  How to hold meetings, what tools to buy, and what
to skip &mdash; it's all here straight from one who's learned the hard
lessons.
<p>
Although software development processes are numerous and well
documented, they don't always fit the time and resource constraints of
an embedded systems startup company.  Often a startup's software team
follows a leaner path to achieve their goal: get a product out on time
with no major defects.  These teams frequently use open source tools and
a mix of hybrid software development life cycle techniques, but there
are as many nuanced processes as there are embedded systems startups.
<p>
What works?  This article provides a set of software development
processes that work well in the context of an embedded systems
startup.  These include:
<ul>
<li> The early stage setup of the software configuration management and
     build policies;
<li> activities during start of the development stage &mdash; from the
     functional requirements document to first customer ship.
</ul>
<p>
While some of these steps may seem obvious, each step described is
vital to achieving the stated goal.
<h2>Minimal tools required</h2>
Starting with the assumption that startups are notoriously cheap
organizations, here is a list of open source tools that startups would
do well to have at their disposal:
<ul>
<li> Software configuration management (SCM) system, such as
     <a href="http://aegis.sourceforge.net/">Aegis</a>;
<li> Scripting languages for builds and reports, such
     as <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> and <a
     href="http://miller.emu.id.au/pmiller/software/cook/">Cook</a>;
<li> Bug-tracking or problem-tracking database,
     such as <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">Bugzilla</a>
     or <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnats">GNATS</a>;
<li> The <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GNU C Compiler</a> suite can be
     configured as a cross compiler for dozens of CPUs;
<li> There are other useful open source tools for embedded development,
     such as <a href="http://srecord.sourceforge.net/">SRecord</a>.
</ul>
<p>
Your software configuration management (SCM) tools, and bug-tracking
database, should preferably have a web based query and reporting
interface.  It is not necessary to export this interface to the world,
having it available on the company's intranet is sufficient.
<h2>Configuration management policies</h2>
Before starting to develop the product, the engineering organization
needs a foundation on which to reliably build and release software.
This foundation should include, at a minimum, support for
documentation, source code, and release tracking.
<h3>Document in SCM and on the web</h3>
You should make sure that all documentation is source code controlled
and also available via the company's intranet.  This step makes it easy
to track, change, and find the latest design and module information.
The documentation should include some means of displaying source changes
and histories so that interested parties (for example, the quality
assurance and documentation groups) can review and note code changes.
The Aegis web interface
(<a href="http://aegis.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/aeget">aeget</a>)
does just this.  It provides a web interface that displays source
history and differences between code revisions, and much more besides.
<p>
You should also have project plan documents (source controlled in the
same repository as the source code) that contain the overall structure
of each major module within the product.  The project plan should
point out the changes to be added to a module in each release.  This
information reduces architectural and release-oriented questions
that might otherwise be foisted on engineers during the cycle, thus
freeing them up from low-priority interrupts.  One of the major jobs
of engineering managers is to protect their engineers from external
information and feature requests.  By having all pertinent information
available online, a manager will reduce some of these requests; others
can usually be handled by the manager himself.
<h3>Plan the release and the merge</h3>
A major release should be represented as a branch off of the current
Aegis trunk.  Minor and patch releases should be branches off of
existing release branches.  Spell out your policies regarding ending
release and support branches (implying when merges back to the main
branch occur).  Do this in a source controlled project planning
document, ideally available via an intranet web page.  Aegis provides
automatic ways to determine the extent of merging required between a
branch and its parent.
<p>
For example, you may use the Linux model, and have odd numbered branches
be development branches, and even numbered branches be release branches.
<h3>Include a reference to a bug ID in change set descriptions</h3>
Every change set has a text description, to convey information concerning
the change set's purpose.  You should add a line to this description
containing the bug ID for the bug tracking system you are using,
for every change set that fixes a bug, or is tracked by your issue
management system.
<p>
Alternatively, each change can be assigned arbitrary text attributes,
and a &ldquo;BugId&rdquo; attribute is not only searchable, but will
automatically appear in change set listings (use a lower case name if
you don't want your change set lists polluted).
<!--
     It would be a Good Thing (TM) if we could have aeget automagically
     turn this into an HTML link to the Bugzilla database for this bug.
     -->
<p>
It is also simple to set up an email notification for every integration,
not only to the software development team, but also to the documentation
and quality assurance teams.
<p>
Once you have two or more developers, it is a good idea to turn
on Aegis' code review features, which ensure that every change
set has been code reviewed <i>before</i> it is integrated.  Aegis
supports many tools for code reviews, including tools such as <a
href="http://www.accurev.com/free/tkdiff/">tkdiff</a> for color coded
GUI code reviews.
<p>
Aegis also provides after-the-fact differences via the command line, or
via the web interface (see the Aegis web site for an example of the <a
href="http://aegis.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/aeget/aegis.4.19.C172?menu">
information available</a> about each change set).
<h2>Build policies</h2>
With the source controlled, it's time to tame the build.  How often
will you build?  What about identifying each software configuration?
What type of notification will take place each time an integration is
completed (or fails)?
<p>
Aegis attempts to ensure that all change sets integrated into the
project &ldquo;work&rdquo;.  This usually includes some concept of
&ldquo;compiles successfully and passes some tests&rdquo;.
<p>
The project build is configured with an automated build command which
is required to report success before your change can be put up for code
review and eventual integration.  This tends to dramatically reduce the
number of commits which result in the entire development team being
unable to build the product.
<h3>Configuration Identifiers</h3>
Every single integration is given a unique identifier by Aegis.  By
burying this identifier (a short text string) in the software at
integration build time, it is possible later to query the software for
this this version string recreate the entire state of the project source
code at the time of integration.
<p>
Because every integration builds the code, there is no need for the
nightly automated build, because it has already been done.  The results
are available for all to see (and use, recalling that it <i>works</i>)
in the branch's baseline.
<h3>Mandate email notification of integrations</h3>
For any integration completed, an email notification should be sent to
the entire software group.  It is simple to configure Aegis to do this
if you want plain text; a little more scripting is necessary for HTML
email with links to various intranet web sources of information.
<p>
The email for each change set should include a listing of all files
integrated into the branch.  In this way, engineers know what parts
of the system have changed or what bugs were potentially fixed.  To
increase the report's usefulness to QA especially, the generating script
should include the configuration identifier.
<h3>Automated Testing</h3>
You may think that automated testing for embedded projects takes far too
many resources, and far too much engineering effort, to be worthwhile
for a startup.
<p>
The build process typically produces a cross compiled image of the
software to be downloaded into the target system.  A very useful
approach is to have the build process <b>also</b> compile a native
executable for the build host.
<p>
Such an executable, while not cycle-identical to the target (in fact, it
will frequently be considerably faster, and a different CPU) <i>can</i>
be automatically tested via scripts on the build host, for very little
additional engineering effort.
<p>
For example: by using conditional C macros for all I/O accesses, the
target code accesses memory directly, but the build host version hands
the access off to a device simulator, effectively allowing you to
exercise the logic all the way to the bottom of your device drivers.
When you run the executable, the console can be attached to the debug port
simulator, giving an authentic (and scriptable) interface to the software
being constructed.
<p>
Unit tests are equally useful on the build host, where they only contain
an isolated portion of the complete code, and not sufficient operating
system or run time environment to be viable on the target system.
<p>
Aegis provides facilities for supporting optional or mandatory tests
accompanying each change set.  By using automated tests in this fashion,
many bugs are caught and squished long before the code is downloaded
into the target system for real world testing (often, for small startup,
tediously manual).
<p>
These tests accumulate in the project, and there is a simple Aegis
command to run the accumulated set of tests in a developer's private
work area before putting a change set up for review and eventual
integration.  Projects rapidly accumulate such tests, and it can
become time consuming to run them all, so a subset can be designated as
a &ldquo;smoke test&rdquo; and a shell script (source controlled, of
course) made available to developers to run them.
<h3>QA and RC branches</h3>
Because the development branch &ldquo;works&rdquo; to the extent that
you have configured Aegis to look for, many QA activities can be validly
performed out of the development branch's baseline.  This can be
sufficient for a small start-up.
<p>
For added insulation against a rapidly changing development branch (or
one that project management has decided to &ldquo;break&rdquo; for a
short time), a QA branch can be opened, with regular updates from the
development branch, either via Aegis branch inheritance mechanism,
or more manually via Aegis' various branch and change set cloning and
reproduction tools.
<p>
Like any other branch, the usual build-test-review-integrate cycle
is performed, giving opportunities for email notification, but also
automatic on-demand builds of the product.
<p>
Release and support branches are most easily handled by ending the
development branch (a branch is just a super change set in Aegis) and
creating two sister branches, and even numbered branch for release and
support, and an odd numbered branch for ongoing development and QA.
<h2>Engineering and QA policies</h2>
Developers are buzzing away on features and fixes, you've got the
automated build and tests happening, so now it's time to engage the
QA people.  Some organizations start QA validation fairly early in
the cycle; others wait for a preordained code freeze milestone before
commencing testing.  Your mileage may vary, and you might be short
changed if QA is working on other releases concurrently.  Once you do
decide to engage QA, here are some tips on what to expect.
<h3>QA and later-cycle RC builds</h3>
Engineers use the integration builds when testing embedded systems on
their target processor and the build host.  The code is first tested on
the build host using an automated test script written by the developer;
possibly through a unit test harness.  Once this indicates the the code
probably works, it can be downloaded onto the target and debugged from
that point.
<p>
Change sets are promoted to the QA branch on a regular basis so that QA
may perform their test suites and validate any fixed bugs.  This can be
automated using Aegis by having the QA branch be a child branch of the
development branch.  By building and integrating an empty change set,
the QA branch's baseline inherits all of the change sets applied to the
parent (development) branch since the last QA integration build.  As a
rule of thumb, a QA import is appropriate once a week so that QA has
enough time to run their test suites and the queue of fixed bugs doesn't
grow too large.  The frequency of QA imports depends on the size of the
project.
<p>
Ideally, QA will write automated test scripts so that bugs can be
reproduced, and the test scripts are imported into the development
branch to be run by developers to make sure that once a bug is fixed, it
<i>stays</i> fixed.  Maybe it is important enough to add to the smoke
test script.
<p>
RC branches should be separate from development branches; ideally you
can end the development branch, and the new RC branch will inherit
all changes.  Incomplete change sets that will not make it into this
release can be cloned onto the new development branch just before the
old development branch ends.
<p>
It is a good idea to archive RC build products (such as flash images
and user documentation sets) so that a precise and exact copy of the
user package is readily available.  (Often necessitated by statistical
FPGA compilers, which never produce the same answer even when given the
same inputs).  They're extremely useful for testing older releases and
release candidates for the existence of some classes of difficult bugs.
<p>
Finally, both QA and RC builds should have their deltas named in Aegis
so they can be reproduced by name, not just by the ID buried in the
executable.  Having delta names also helps generate the various reports
so that engineering team and QA can see what fixes made it into each
baseline.
<h3>Turning knobs &mdash; time vs. resources</h3>
Which knob are you going to turn?  Do you have the luxury of time in your
schedule to take your project to zero defects, or will you be forced to
settle for zero fatal and major defects?  Can you move resources either
within QA or into QA to help the time crunch?  The more challenging part
of a release is the trade off when confronted with a time-constrained
release or resource-constrained release.  While there are no short
answers to problems such as these, once you know where you are and
where you should be, you can gauge what knobs to turn.  The key is
understanding your current position.
<h3>Hold regular meetings</h3>
Hold regular meetings to consider the state of the release.  You should
require two types of meetings: the daily bug meeting and the weekly
product review meeting.
<h4>Daily bug meeting</h4>
The first of meeting goes under different names at different companies
but for our purposes I'll call it a daily bug meeting.  Whatever you
call it, the meeting's goal is defined as taking a regular and frequent
(daily is the norm) snapshot of the current bug state of a release.
Early in the cycle numerous bugs may be on the list so you should
concentrate on a those with a high priority.
<p>
The first part of the daily bug meeting should be devoted to the bug
review.  The meeting coordinator (either the project manager or the
engineering manager in charge) runs a projector that displays a summary
and individual bug reports.  The latter part of the meeting should look
at the bug queues (new, open, fixed) and outstanding issues to determine
how the release is progressing along.  The benefits of a regular review
are many:
<ul>
<li> All of the responsible parties are up-to-date on the state of the
     release &mdash; thus it makes sense to include a representative
     from each of the stake holders for the release &mdash; engineering,
     QA, product marketing, program management, manufacturing, and
     documentation if possible;
<li> Bug priorities can be assigned &mdash; later in the cycle this
     becomes a critical determinate of whether a bug will be fixed
     before shipping;
<li> Late feature requests can be judged for merit.
</ul>
<p>
Note that some projects are so small that this meeting can quite
profitably be replaced with the project manager looking at new bugs
since yesterday and assigning them priorities and dispatching them to
the responsible developer by email.  Even in large organizations this
can be very effective.  The point is to deal with bugs rapidly, rather
than let them accumulate to just before a release when you have no
resources to spare to fix them.  If you have to have a daily meeting,
consider doing it in a room without chairs, it is amazing how short
meetings can be when held this way.
<h4>Weekly product review meeting</h4>
The second required meeting is a product review meeting, during which
all of the stake holders are required to meet and review the progress
of the product's release as a whole.  This weekly meeting should be
called by the marketing product manager and should be attended by the
same people as the daily bug meeting plus some senior marketing and
manufacturing heads.  The purpose is to ensure the release stays on
schedule and that the disparate groups coordinate their efforts (is the
web site up, is the marketing collateral in shape, will the product
launch at any trade shows?).
<p>
In small startups, this meeting can be very small and frequently has
only the team leader or project manager representing the developers (and
he's up-to-date because he reads the integration email notifications)
and QA and marketing.
<h2>Toward the end game</h2>
So you have these wonderful policies implemented and your process is
humming, new source developed, and at some point the QA builds start.
What now?  There should be some time in the schedule for a code freeze.
That point may be determined by some heuristic like a graph showing
open bugs vs. closed over time, or it may be the hard-and-fast
requirement of a predetermined schedule.  It all depends on what knobs
you're able to turn.  At code freeze, the bar is set higher &mdash; software
engineers are advised to check-in only the bugs at a threshold
priority.  QA must turn around and verify bug fixes with a high degree
of reliability for both the fixes themselves and for the time that it
takes to test them.
<h3>Open vs. fixed graph</h3>
A graph that displays open vs. fixed issues can provide insight on
stability of the release (number of open issues) and QA loading (number
of fixed bugs waiting close).  For example, consider the graph in Figure
3; the open issues are being handled even though there are still five
waiting for a fix.  The to-be-fixed queue is rising, indicating that QA
is lagging closing out bugs.  A decision maker might look at this and
decide to move some QA resources to help close out this release.
<p>
Aegis can provide histograms of change sets making their way through the
process, or you can mine Aegis' meta-data and make your own.  Note,
however, that this is implementation focused.
<p>
Another source of data, and probably more issue focused, is the bug
state information from your bug tracking tools, such as Bugzilla.
Statistics like these can also be graphed automatically on a web page
through some CGI scripting.
<h3>Beta</h3>
To get to this stage and have a product ready for customer trial, only
minor issues should be outstanding (or at least one or two major issues
with workarounds).  The open vs. fixed graph should be trending
downward, and the frequency of bug meetings should be reduced to once
or twice a week, and the majority of the discussion should be on
coordination issues with the documentation group on how to characterize
any lingering issues.  Most of the engineering group should have already
started on the next release with some possibly working on a follow-up
maintenance or patch release and others on the next major release.
<h3>First customer ship</h3>
Ah, you are done.  Or are you?  Congratulate yourself and your team and
then get ready to start pushing the rock uphill once more.  Often the
release team should host a post-release meeting to go over what did and
did not succeed during the cycle.  This is a great time to fine tune
your release process.
<p>
Along the way you might consider some additional questions.  Have you
started on a maintenance release?  Have you checked with your sales
or support engineer (quite a valuable and underutilized resource for
internal status checks) on how the release is being accepted?  Has
anyone considered a customer survey to see if the release produced as it
promised or if it missed the mark?
<h2>Too Much Process</h2>
It is possible that the process describe here is much to heavy.  Maybe
your startup has only a couple of developers and a one-man CEO slash
marketing slash sales group.
<p>
The software development process described here (automated builds, full
code reviews, host based automated testing) works, even when (especially
when?) there is only a small number of developers, and it scales to
accommodate your growth.  Aegis does most of the work, releasing
developers from paper-work hell.  The automation of builds and the
validations provided by tests and code reviews give you needed stability
so that your team can focus on actually making your product.
