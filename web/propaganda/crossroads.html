CM Crossroads</a>
</h1>
<a href="http://www.cmcrossroads.com/">CM Crossroads</a> bills itself
as the worlds largest online community and resource center for
configuration management. <a href="http://www.cmcrossroads.com/">CM
Crossroads</a> hosts interactive discussion forums, a book
store, a monthly newsletter, Career Search and Jobs Board, an
extensive library of resource links a user contributed file
cabinet and the Configuration Management Body of Knowledge (<a
href="http://www.cmwiki.com">CMBoK</a>).
<p>
The only down-side is that they are funded by advertising, and as a
result, open source alternatives are rarely mentioned.
With rare exceptions, don't mention <i>any</i> OSS VC/SCM other than CVS.

The Trouble with Hidden Make Targets</a>
<dd>
A nasty trap for the unwary that can cause <i>make</i>(1) to report
odd errors, stops the -n option from working and prevents speedy
parallel Make. It can even cause Make to do the wrong work and update an
up-to-date file.

Setting a Makefile variable from outside the Makefile</a><dd>
It's common to have options in a Makefile that you alter when you start
a build. Perhaps the most common is a DEBUG option used to specify
whether the build you are doing creates debuggable or release code.
<p>
The relevance for Aegis users is that this can be automated by different
<i>integration_build_command</i> and <i>build_command</i> fields of
the project configuration file.

Source Control HOWTO</a><dd>
Our universities don't teach people how to do source control.  Our
employers don't teach people how to do source control.  SCM tool vendors
don't teach people how to do source control.  We need some materials
that explain how source control is done.  My goal for this series of
articles is to create a comprehensive guide to help meet this need.

Making Incremental Integration Work for You</a><dd>
Integrating a change at a time needs a tool which supports change sets.
More than that, it must support incremental development environments,
incremental impact analysis and the ability to roll back changes easily.

<a href="http://www.cmcrossroads.com/article/35661">The Role of
Incremental Integration in a Parallel Development Environment</a><dd>
Team software development is a reality because one person cannot develop
todays complex software applications in a timely manner.  One of the
greatest challenges of team software development is integrating the
changes made by several developers, each completing coding tasks in an
isolated environment.

Approaching Continuous Integration</a><dd>
The term continuous integration is getting a bit of attention these
days. It refers to the process of integrating often (or immediately) to
reduce integration effort, complexity, and pain and to make changes more
readily available to others.
