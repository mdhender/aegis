        Software development is often supported by specialized programs
        called "Software Configuration Management" (SCM) tools.  SCM
        tools often control who can read and modify the source code of a
        program, keep history information (so that people can find
        out what changed between versions, and who changed them), and
        generally help developers work together to improve a program
        under development.

        Problem is, the people who develop SCM tools often don't
        think about what kind of security requirements they need to
        support.  This mini-paper describes briefly the kinds of
        security requirements an SCM tool should support.  Not every
        project may need everything, but it's easy to not notice some
        important requirements if you don't think about them.  There are
        two basic types of SCM tools, "centralized" and "distributed";
        the basic security needs are the same, but how these needs
        can be handled are different between the two different types.
        I'm primarily concentrating on basic SCM tools (like CVS,
        Subversion, GNU Arch, Bitkeeper, Perforce, and so on).  Clearly
        related tools include build tools, automated (regression) test
        tools, bug tracking tools, static analysis tools, process
        automation tools, software development tools (such as editors,
        compilers, and IDEs), and so on.
</td><td width="50%" valign=top bgcolor="#eeeeee">
        Aegis was designed from the very beginning with security in
        mind.  Indeed, for some time it provided rather more security
        than open source developers needed or wanted.
	<p>
        Recent developments have provided additional configuration
        options to allow a more relaxed security profile than is
        provided by default.

        An SCM has several assets to protect.  It needs to protect
        "current" versions of software, but it must do much more.  It
        needs to make sure that it can recall any previous version of
        software, correctly, as well as the audit trail of exactly who
        made which change and when.  In particular, an SCM has to keep
        the history <i>immutable</i> - once a change is made, it needs
        to stay recorded.  You can undo the change, but the undoing
        needs to be recorded separately.  Very old history may need
        to be removed and archived, but that's different than simply
        allowing history to be deleted.
</td><td width="50%" valign=top bgcolor="#eeeeee">
        Aegis has complete control of the history of a project and the
        associated meta-data.  All change sets are preserved forever.
	<p>
        Most aspects of Aegis' meta-data are immutable.  Only project
        administrators may change the description of a change once
        it has been committed to the repository (developers are
        notoriously bad at accurately describing their changes); project
        administrators cannot alter any information about the file
        histories or the various users and time stamps the change set has
        accrued.

	Aegis was designed from the ground up to cope with a number of threats.
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="50%" valign=top>
        Individual projects may choose to not employ a given
        counter-measure, since they may decide that's not a threat for
        them.  For example, open source software (OSS) projects may
        decide that there's no "threat" of unauthorized reading of
        software, since the code is open to reading by all.  However,
        that may not always be true - many OSS projects hide changes
        that reveal security vulnerabilities until the new version is
        ready for deployment.  Thus, it's difficult to make simple
        statements like "projects of type X never need to worry about
        threat Y".  Instead, it's simpler to list some potential
        threats, and then projects can decide which ones apply to them
        (and configure their SCM system to counter them).
</td><td width="50%" valign=top bgcolor="#eeeeee">
        Aegis provides the ability to customize many aspects of the
        process which change sets travel through to be included in the
        project repository.
	<p>
        The default configuration is medium paranoid.  It is possible
        to increase that to extremely paranoid (or extremely officious,
        depending on your perspective), or weaken it to merely be
        helpful.

	<i>Outsiders without privileges</i>
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="50%" valign=top>
        An outsider (not a developer or administrator) may try to read
        or modify assets (software source code or history information)
        when they're not authorized to do so.  SCM systems should
        support authorization (like login systems), and support a
        definition of what unauthorized users can do.  An SCM system
        should support configurations that allow anonymous reading of
        a project and/or its history, since there are many cases where
        that's useful.  However, SCMs should also support forbidding
        anonymous read access.  That's even true for OSS projects, since
        as I noted above, sometimes OSS projects want to hide security
        fixes until they're ready for deployment.
</td><td width="50%" valign=top bgcolor="#eeeeee">
        By using the UNIX groups facility (see <i>group</i>(5) for
        more information) it is possible to limit the read access to a
        project to members of a single group.
	<p>
        However, this leaks the existence of the project.  By using the
        AEGIS_PATH environment variable, telling Aegis where to look
        for projects, it is also possible to conceal the existence of a
        project.
	<p>
        Aegis has separate ACLs to developers, reviewers and
        integrators, limiting the number of users who can modify the
        project - but even then, they must follow the process.
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="50%" valign=top>
        Normally unauthorized users shouldn't be allowed to modify
        a source repository, so an SCM should support that (and
        should make that the default).  In rare cases, it's possible
        to imagine that even this constraint isn't true, especially
        if the SCM tool is designed to be used for resources
        other than source code.  Most Wiki systems such as <a
        href="http://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> allow anonymous
        changes; they work instead by protecting the <i>history</i>
        of changes so that everyone will know exactly what's changed,
        instead of preventing writing of the primary data.  Such
        approaches are rare for software code; for example, the
        Wikipedia software itself (as stored in its trusted repository)
        can only be changed by a few privileged developers.  However,
        it is conceivable that software documentation and code would be
        maintained by the same SCM software, and perhaps a few projects
        would allow anyone to update the documentation as long as all
        changes were tracked and could be easily reversed.
</td><td width="50%" valign=top bgcolor="#eeeeee">
        Aegis is very strict about which users are authorized to create
        and modify change sets.  If you are not in the appropriate ACL,
        you may not perform the action.
	<p>
        It would be possible (although this isn't the case at present)
        to add code to Aegis to allow "anybody" to be a change set
        developer.  It is probably most undesirable to allow "anybody"
        to be a code reviewer or integrator.
	<p>
        Aegis breaks the traditional "commit" step into several pieces.
        Large project are able to be configured to require a user other
        than the developer to perform the code review step (this is
        the default).  Thus, it is safe for naive developers to modify
        any source file they like, but they have to get it past a
        code reviewer before it will appear in the repository.  There
        are facilities in Aegis to require specific code reviewers for
        specific portions of the code.

        The underlying identification and authentication system (the
        login system) can use intrusion detection systems to detect
        likely attempts to forge privileges (e.g., by detecting password
        guessing attacks, or detecting improbable locations of a login).
        The underlying login system could also support enabling limits
        (e.g., delays after X login attempts, or only permitting logins
        from certain Internet Protocol address ranges for certain
        developers).  However, these mechanisms need to not create a
        denial-of-service attack; otherwise, an attacker might try to
        forge logins not to actually log in, but to prevent legitimate
        users from doing so.

        SCM systems could usefully limit reading to particular projects,
        say.  Limiting reading of specific files inside a project
        can be useful, but it often isn't as useful inside a branch
        developers must access because developers often need the entire
        set of files to develop (e.g., to recompile something).  But
        limiting who can read changes in certain branches could be vital
        for some projects.  For example, it is common for security
        vulnerabilities to be reported to a smaller group of people than
        the entire development staff, and for the patch to be developed
        by specially trusted developers without full knowledge of all
        developers.  This is particularly true for open source software
        projects, but it's also sometimes true for other projects.  This
        kind of functionality can also be important for projects such as
        military projects with varying degrees of confidentiality; most
        of the program may be "unclassified", but with a poor or stubbed
        algorithm; there may be a better classified algorithm, but it
        will need to be maintained separately.  Ideally, the SCM should
        be trustworthy enough to protect that data, though in practice
        such trust is rarely granted; an SCM should instead gracefully
        handle importing the "unclassified" version and automatically
        merging the "classified" data on equipment trusted to do so.

        Aegis does not provide this facility on a per-file or

        a change, it's easy to see who made what changes, in any time

        an attacker with the credentials (e.g., cryptographic keys) of
        a developer -- but in either case, once you find out who did a
        malicious act, the SCM should make it easy to identify all of

        In particular, it may be useful to "cycle" developer private

	<!-- Thanks to cabo, at, informatik.uni-bremen.de. -->
        On April 11, 2004, Dr. Carsten Bormann from the University of
        Bremen sent me an email about a specialized attack that he
        terms the "encumbrance pollution attack".  In an encumbrance
        pollution attack, the attacker inserts material that cannot be
        legally included.  To understand it, first imagine an SCM with
        perfectly indestructible history.  The attacker steals developer
        credentials, or is himself a malicious developer, and checks in
        a change that contains some encumbered material.  "Encumbered"
        material is simply material which cannot be legally included.
        Examples include child pornography, slanderous/libelous
        statements, or code which has copyright or patent encumbrances.
        This could be very advantageous, for example, a company might
        hire a malicious developer to insert that company's code into
        a competing product, and then sue the competitor for copyright
        infringement, knowing that their SCM system "can't" undo the
        problem.  Or a lazy programmer might copy code that they have no
        right to copy (this is rare in open source software projects,
        because every line of code and who provided it is a matter of
        public record, but it proprietary projects do have this risk).
        Any SCM can record a change that essentially undoes a previous
        change, but if the history is indestructible and viewable by
        all, then you can't get rid of the history.  This makes your
        SCM archive irrevocably encumbered.  This can especially be a
        problem if the SCM is indestructibly recording proposals by
        outsiders!  An SCM system could be designed so that a special
        privilege allowed someone to completely deletion the history
        data of illegal changes, of course.  However, if there are
        special privileges to delete history data, it might be possible
        to misuse those privileges to cause other problems.
	<p>
        One mechanism for dealing with an encumbrance pollution attack
        is to allow specially-privileged accounts to "mask" history
        elements; i.e., preventing access to certain material by normal
        developers so that it's no longer available, so that the
        material isn't included in later versions (essentially it works
        like an "undo" against that change).  However, a "mask" would
        still record the event in some way so that it would be possible
        to prove that the event occurred at a later time.  Perhaps the
        system could record a hash of the encumbered change, allowing
        the encumbered material to be removed from the normal repository
        yet proving that, at one time, the material was included.  A
        "masking" should include a cryptographic signature of whoever
        did the masking.  This mechanism in particular requires careful
        design, because the mechanism should be design so that it
        doesn't permit other attacks.

        An SCM should be able to prevent read access, even if the
        repository is attacked.  The obvious way to do this is by using
        encrypted archives.  But there are many variations on this
        theme, primarily in where the key(s) are stored for decryption.
        If the real problem is just to make sure that backup media or
        transfer disks aren't easily read, the key could simply be
        stored on a separate (more protected) media.  The archive keys
        might only be stored in RAM, and required on boot up; this is
        more annoying for boot up, and an attacker is likely to be able
        to acquire the data anyway.  The repository might not normally
        have the keys necessary to decrypt the archive contents at all;
        it could require the developer to provide those keys, which
        it uses and then destroys.  This is harder to attack, but a
        determined adversary could subvert the repository program (or
        memory) and get the key.  Another alternative is to arrange for
        the repository to <i>not</i> have the keys necessary to decrypt
        the archive contents at any time.  In this case, developers
        must somehow be provided with the keys necessary to do the
        decryption, and essentially the repository doesn't really "know"
        the contents of the files it's managing!

        Aegis has no support for encrypted meta-data, and limited

        not have the developer's keys.

        Aegis was designed long before this concept evolved.  Its
        meta-data is not in a form which allows it to be placed in an

        in another immutable file.
	<p>
        Portions of the meta-data are immutable, but because it is
        stored in the same file as some changeable data (for example,
        where the change set is in the process) digital signatures are
        problematic.
