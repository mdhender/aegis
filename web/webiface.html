Aegis \*(v)<br>Web Interface
</h1>
Aegis has a read-only web interface to its database.  There is a page
which uses Aegis' own web interface to look at Aegis' own development
(because Aegis is developed using Aegis).  If you have Apache installed
when Aegis is configured and built, this interface (to your projects,
not this one) will be installed for you at your site, too.

        The <i>Download</i> links are of most interest to Aegis

    <h2>SourceForge Hack</h2>
    This section contains instructions for building and installing the CGI
    interface like the one that runs at <tt>sourceforge.net</tt>, but on
    your own server.  You need an externally accessible server, outside your
    firewall, to host an Internet accessible Aegis project in this way.
    <p>
    You then update the external tree using <i>rsync</i> or similar, either
    weekly or at integrate pass, or something.
    <p>
    Using the Aegis web interface like the one on SourceForge is a little
    different than
    at your own site, due to the chroot jail that is used.  (Change these
    instructions to suit the name of your project.)  You wont be able to
    compile on SourceForge, so do it on a Linux PC elsewhere.
    <ol>
    <li>
    Configure with <i>./configure
    --prefix=/home/groups/a/ae/aegis
    --with-no-aegis-configured</i>
    <li>
    Edit the generated Makefile,
    <ul>
    <li>add <tt>-DSOURCE_FORGE_HACK</tt> to the CXXFLAGS variable;
    <li>add <tt>-static</tt> to the LDFLAGS variable, to make sure the right
    version of the libraries statically linked into the executables.
    </ul>
    <li>
    Now you can <i>make</i> as normal.
    <li>
    You can use the DESTDIR setting of the Makefile, or you can
    <i>mkdir -p /home/groups/a/ae/aegis/cgi-bin</i>
    <li>
    When you <i>make install</i>, you will then need to cull the install
    tree of unnecessary files.
    You only need
    <i>bin/ae_diff2htm</i>,
    <i>bin/aedist</i>,
    <i>bin/aeget</i>,
    <i>bin/aegis</i>,
    <i>bin/aegis.cgi</i>,
    <i>bin/aepatch</i>,
    <i>bin/aerect</i>,
    <i>bin/aereport</i>,
    <i>bin/aetar</i>,
    and the
    <i>share/en/html</i> tree.
    The rest can be removed.
    <blockquote>
<pre>cd /home/groups/a/ae/aegis
mkdir -m755 cgi-bin
for f in \e
    aeannotate aebuffy aecomp aecomplete ae-cvs-ci        \e
    aecvsserver aeedit aefind aeget.instal aegis.cgi.i    \e

    ae-sccs-put aesub aexml tkaeca tkaegis tkaenc tkaepa  \e
    tkaer xaegis
do
    rm bin/$f
done
strip bin/*
rm -r com lib man etc
mkdir -p share-new/en
mv share/en/html share-new/en
rm -r share
mv share-new share</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <li>
    You will need to create a couple of shell scripts in the <i>cgi-bin</i>
    directory to set the command search PATH and then invoke <i>aeget</i>
    or <i>aegis.cgi</i> as appropriate.
    <blockquote>
<pre>#!/bin/sh
cmd=`basename $0`
bin=/home/groups/a/ae/aegis/bin
PATH=${bin}:$PATH
export PATH
exec $bin/$cmd "$@"</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <li>
    Total size is about 50MB (shared libraries would <i>really</i> help).
    Make a tarball, <i>scp</i> it to SourceForge, unpack at the other end.
    <blockquote>
<pre>tar czf xxx.tgz bin cgi-bin share
scp xxx.tgz aegis.sourceforge.net:.
ssh aegis.sourceforge.net
cd /home/groups/a/ae/aegis
tar xf ~/xxx.tgz
cd
rm xxx.tgz
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    The tarball is about 15MB so the upload time isn't too bad.
    <li>
    <a name="num7" >Now upload your project.</a>
    I use <i>rsync</i> for efficient differential
    uploads.  The directory needs to be inside the chroot jail, but outside
    the <i>htdocs</i> directory.
    The instructions assume it is in the
    <tt >/home/groups/<i >p</i>/<i >pr</i>/<i >project</i>/<i >project</i></tt>
    directory.
    You need the whole project tree, but you can leave out derived files
    in the baselines (<i>e.g.</i> <tt>.o</tt> files, <tt>.a</tt> files and
    executables).
    <li>
    Edit <tt >/home/groups/<i >p</i>/<i >pr</i>/<i
    >project</i>/com/aegis/state</tt> to point at the project tree.
    Something like <blockquote>
<pre>where =
[
  {
    project_name = "<i>project</i>";
    directory = "/home/groups/<i >p</i>/<i >pr</i>/<i >project</i>/<i
    >project</i>";
  },
];</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <li>
    If this takes off, I'll ask the SourceForge people to install it, so
    that most of these instructions are unnecessary.
    </ol>
