Dear Source Forge Administrator,
<p>
<a href="http://aegis.sourceforge.net/">Aegis</a> is a software
configuration management tool.
<p>
It has been under active development for 15 years,
and still is today.  It is not small.
<p>
The Aegis web site and <tt>/home/groups/a/ae/aegis/aegis</tt> data
directory serve three purposes:
<ol><li>
    to provide Aegis-style web access for projects who use Aegis as their
    SCM.  You can get an idea of how many projects are involved via
    <a href="http://aegis.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/aeget">
    http://aegis.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/aeget</a>.
    <p>
    Not a huge number, but then, not all projects using Aegis are hosted on
    SourceForge, and not all of them want to be linked into this project
    list.
    <p>
    The files in <tt>/home/groups/a/ae/aegis/cgi-bin</tt> support this activity.
    <p>
<li>
    The web site provides access for other Aegis maintainers to download
    change sets via the <a
.nf
href="http://mysite.verizon.net/ralph.a.smith1/aegis/refman-html/rn03re26.html"
.fi
    ><i>aedist</i>(1)</a> distributed development mechanism.
    <p>
    You may like to consult the <a href="refman.pdf"
    >Aegis Reference Manual</a> for the relevant man
    page, the <a
.nf
href="http://mysite.verizon.net/ralph.a.smith1/aegis/user-guide-html/\
ug-c10_0-geographically_distributed_development.html"
.fi
    ><i>Geographically Distributed Development</i></a> chapter of the <a
    href="user-guide.pdf" >Aegis User Guide</a>, and the <a
.nf
href="http://mysite.verizon.net/ralph.a.smith1/aegis/howto-html/\
working_in_teams.html"
.fi
    ><i>Working In Teams</i></a> section of the <a href="howto.pdf">Aegis
    How To</a>.
    <p>
    The files in <tt>/home/groups/a/ae/aegis/aegis</tt> support this activity.
    <p>
<li>
    The web site serves as an example to potential users of Aegis how
    the distributed development facilities work, and it provides those
    facilities to other Source Forge projects which use Aegis to develop
    their software.
</ol>
<p>
The directories are already as small as they can be and still provide
meaningful example to potential users, or a meaningful distributed
development mechanism for Aegis developers.

<i>While you may have answered some (or all) of these questions already,
please answer them again, in this order, to ease the handling of this
request.</i><p>
<dl>
<dt><i>1. Is this request for a user or a project?</i><dd>
    This is a request for a project.
    <p>

<dt><i>2. What is the user name or project UNIX name?</i><dd>
    <a href="http://aegis.sourceforge.net/">aegis</a>.
    <p>

<dt><i>3. What would you like your new quota to be?</i><dd>
    Please increase the disk quota to 1GB.
    <p>

<dt><i>4. Have you reviewed your current content on disk, and pruned all
unnecessary content prior to making this request?</i><dd>
    Yes.
    The directories are already as small as they can be and still provide
    meaningful example to potential users, or a meaningful distributed
    development mechanism for Aegis developers.
    <p>

<dt><i>5. Why do you need more than the standard quota?</i><dd>
    <a href="http://aegis.sourceforge.net/">Aegis</a> is a software
    configuration management tool.
    It has been under active development for 15 years,
    and still is today.  It is not small.
    <p>
    The <tt>/home/groups/a/ae/aegis/cgi-bin</tt> directory contains a
    number of programs which facilitate distributed development using
    Aegis.  These are used by a number of other SourceForge projects, see
    <a href="http://aegis.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/aeget" >
    http://aegis.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/aeget </a> for a list.
    <p>
    The <tt>/home/groups/a/ae/aegis/aegis</tt> directory contains
    a carefully winnowed copy of the Aegis repository, both to
    demonstrate how Aegis is used for distributed development, and to
    facilitate distributed development of Aegis itself.

<dt><i>6. If this is for a user quota, why can't you use the project home
directory for this activity?</i><dd>
    Not applicable, the request is for a project quota.
    <p>

<dt><i>7. Have you already been granted a quota increase in the past?
If so, please provide a reference to it here (URL, copy of email
contents, etc.).</i><dd>
    <b>Yes,</b> by David Burley.  See <a
