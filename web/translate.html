Aegis Localization
</h1>

The error messages in Aegis have been internationalized.  This means that
you can read error messages in your native language, if a translation has
been provided.  (Also known as localization.)  The following table lists
the available translations, and gives credit to the volunteer translators
who generously donated their time to perform the translation.

<h2> The Translation project </h2>

The <a href="http://translationproject.org/" >Translation Project</a>
is meant as a service to
both package maintainers and translators.  The advantage for maintainers
is that they need to announce a new POT file to just one address and can
fetch the translated PO files from just one place, instead of having to
deal with several translators separately.  For translators the advantages
are similar: they receive the POT file announcements and pre-merged
PO files from a single place and send in their PO files via a single
mechanism, instead of having to deal in different ways with several
maintainers separately.
<p>
At the <a href="http://translationproject.org/" >Translation
Project</a> translators are grouped into language teams (rather
than package teams) because, in general, translation issues are
more specific to a human language than to a particular package.
It is good for translators of the same language to get together,
check each other's work, and discuss any problematic translation
issues.  This also increases the chances that all packages at the
<a href="http://translationproject.org/" >Translation Project</a>
get translated in a similar manner, using the same conventions and a
consistent vocabulary.  Lone translators tend to find their own ways and
words, making your package stand out as strange.
<p>
If <i>you</i> are able to translate the Aegis error messages into another
language, please join the appropriae language team at the
<a href="http://translationproject.org/" >Translation Project</a>.

<h3> English </h3>

Aegis has an <i>English</i> error message translation.  This is because
the error messages (the <tt>msgid</tt> fields) are rather cryptic
and usually short.  Think of this is programmer-speak.  The English
(<i>en</i>) translates the programmer-speak error messages to English.
<p>
If you are translating the error messages, please translate the English
<tt>msgstr</tt> fields.  Please do not start with a blank <tt>.pot</tt>
file and translate the <tt>msgid</tt> fields, you will quickly discover
you do not have enough information available to translate the messages
properly.  The English translation also contains extensive comments for
each error message, giving context and substitution information.

<h2>Instructions for Translators</h2>

If you would like to translate the Aegis error messages, look up the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/iso639.htm" >two-letter
abbreviation</a> of the language you are going to translate the error
messages to.  The rest of these instructions will call it <i>xx</i>.
<p>
In the source tarball, you will see a directory called
<tt>lib/en/LC_MESSAGES</tt> which contains some <tt>.po</tt> files.
These are the text form of the message catalogues.
You can view them with a simple text editor.
<p>
Create a new directory for your translations, and copy the English
messages into it.
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>mkdir lib/<i>xx</i>/LC_MESSAGES
cp lib/en/LC_MESSAGES/aegis.po lib/<i>xx</i>/LC_MESSAGES</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Now you need to edit each of the <tt>lib/<i>xx</i>/LC_MESSAGES/*.po</tt>
files, replacing the <tt>msgstr</tt> strings with suitable translations.
Leave the <tt>msgid</tt> strings and the comments untranslated.
These are text files, you can edit them with a simple text editor.
GNU Emacs has a PO mode to make this easier.
<p>
The <a href="http://www.gnu.org/directory/gettext.html"
>GNU Gettext</a> sources have fairly good
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/manual/gettext/index.html"
>documentation</a> about this process.
<p>
If you want to test your translations, you need to "compile" the text into
the binary form used by the <tt>gettext()</tt> system call.  This is done
using the <i>msgfmt</i>(1) program from the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/directory/gettext.html" >GNU Gettext</a>
package.  To see you new translations in action, you create a
<tt>${prefix}/lib/aegis/<i>xx</i>/LC_MESSAGES</tt> directory and arrange
for the <i>msgfmt</i> output to be placed in it.
Some of the messages are hard to trigger, don't expect complete test coverage.
<p>
There are almost 600 error messages.
If you average 1 message every 2 minutes, this is approximately 20 hours work.
The German translation, for example, required around 12 hours.
<p>
When you are done translating, submit the results to the
<a href="http://translationproject.org/" >Translation
Project</a> and they will archived there, as well as sent to <a
href="mailto:pmiller%40opensource.org.au" >Peter Miller</a> to be included
in the next release of Aegis.
