<center>Aegis \*(v)<br>Year 2000 Status</center></h1>
Aegis does not suffer from Year 2000 problems.
<br clear=all>
<ul>
<li>
Aegis stores dates internally in Unix style (<i>i.e.</i> seconds
offset), so internal storage of times and dates does not suffer from
any Y2K problems.
<li>
Aegis always uses the ANSI C standard <tt>strftime</tt> function to display
times and dates.  (This assumes that your vendor has supplied a compliant
<tt>strftime</tt>.)  This means that displaying dates does not assume
fixed field widths, nor will it display the year 2000 as &ldquo;100&rdquo;.
<li>
When a user enters dates, they may specify years with an explicit century.
If a user enters a year with an implicit century, the closest is assumed.
</ul>
