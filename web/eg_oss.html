Aegis \*(v)<br/>Template OSS Project</h1>

This worked example shows you how to get an existing OSS project managed
by Aegis in less than 30 minutes.

<h2> Requirements </h2>
There are a number assumptions made by this example:
<ul><li>
    You have already downloaded, built and installed Aegis; or you
    installed the <tt>aegis</tt> package using your operating system's
    package management software.
    You need Aegis version 4.22 or later for these instructions to work.
<li>
    You have a distribution tarball (a <tt>*.tar.gz</tt> file) of the
    project you want to manage with Aegis.
    In this example, we will be working with <tt><a
    href="vgrabbj.sourceforge.net" >vgrabbj</a>-0.9.6.tar.gz</tt> <a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=25978"
    >downloaded</a> from SourceForge.net.
<li>
    The project is relatively simple: a single <tt>configure.ac</tt>
    or <tt>configure.in</tt> file, and that file is in the top-level
    directory, and an optional <tt>Makefile.am</tt> file, also in the
    top-level directory.
<li>
    The assumption is made that you are using an X11 graphical environment.
    Alternate text-based interfaces are available and will be noted,
    but they are slightly more difficult to use.
</ul>
<p>
If your project is more complicated than this, and many are, you may
be able to adapt these instructions once you understand what they are
trying to achieve.  I recommend you read on, and keep notes of where you
will have to change things.
<p>
These instructions do not assume you are the primary maintainer of this
OSS project, you just want &ldquo;a local branch&rdquo; for hacking on.  These
instructions will work just as well for a maintainer, but they do not
cover migrating from the present version control tool to Aegis.

<h2>Creating a New Project</h2>
<p>
The first thing to do is create the project.  In order to have good
security for your project, the user account which owns the project files
needs to be different than the developers.  This prevents accidents
where the master source could be broken accidentally.
<p>
In this example, we will call that user &ldquo;repos&rdquo;.
Create this user in the usual way for your operating system.
<p>
Because this example is going to be talking about two accounts, the
<tt>repos</tt> account, and your usual user account, this example will
call your usual user account &ldquo;user&rdquo;.
<p>
Now, to create the project, use this command:

<blockquote>
<pre>user$ <b>su - repos</b>
password:
repos$ <b>aegis -new-project vgrabbj -version -</b>
repos$</pre>
</blockquote>

The &ldquo;<tt>&ndash;version &ndash;</tt>&rdquo; tells Aegis you don't
want it to create a branch hierarchy just yet.
<p>
The project directory tree will be established in the
<tt>repos</tt> user's home directory.  You can put it somewhere
else using the <tt>-directory</tt> command line option, so long as the
<tt>repos</tt> user has write permissions to create that directory.
<p>
Next, add you usual user account as a project administrator, using this
command:

<blockquote>
<pre>repos$ <b>aegis -new-administrator</b> <i>user</i> <b>-p vgrabbj</b>
repos$</pre>
</blockquote>

Remember to replace <i>user</i> with your actual user name.
<p>
The above command established your usual account as a project
administrator.  All of the remaining steps to create the project may be
done from your normal account.

<blockquote>
<pre>repos$ <b>exit</b>
user$</pre>
</blockquote>

The next step is to add yourself to all of the remaining project roles:
developer, reviewer and integrator.
You can do this, because you are a project administrator.

<blockquote>
<pre>user$ <b>ae_p vgrabbj</b>
user$ <b>aend</b> <i>user</i>
user$ <b>aenrv</b> <i>user</i>
user$ <b>aeni</b> <i>user</i>
user$</pre>
</blockquote>

The next task is to set the project attributes.
This is most easily done by using the <i>tkaepa</i>(1) command.

<blockquote>
<pre>user$ <b>tkaepa</b>
user$</pre>
</blockquote>

<b>Note:</b> if you aren't using X11, the <i>aepa</i>(1) command will
does the same job, and it's what <i>tkaepa</i>(1) invokes, but you
will need to read the <i>aepattr</i>(5) man page for the expected input
format.  For novices, the GUI interface is easier.
<p>
You want to turn on just about everything.
For a single person project, turn on
<ul><li>
    &ldquo;developers may create changes&rdquo;,
<li>
    &ldquo;developer may review&rdquo;,
<li>
    &ldquo;developer may integrate&rdquo; and
<li>
    &ldquo;reviewer may integrate&rdquo;.
<li>
    If you don't have second person to act as a reviewer,
    and at this point you probably don't,
    select &ldquo;Develop End goes to Awaiting Integration&rdquo;.
<li>
    lastly, give your project a short descriptive title, for <tt>vgrabbj</tt>
    this should read &ldquo;Simple Video4Linux image grabber&rdquo;.
</ul>
<p>
The last step is to create the branches.  Assuming vgrabbj is at version
0.9.6, we will create the 0 and 0.9 branches.

<blockquote>
<pre>user$ <b>aegis -new-branch -p vgrabbj 0</b>
user$ <b>aegis -new-branch -p vgrabbj.0 9</b>
user$</pre>
</blockquote>

Things are nearly ready to go.

<h2>Establishing the Development Environment</h2>

At this point, Aegis needs some basic project configurations.
These are kept in source files inside the project repository,
so that they are versioned.
<p>
The necessary settings and their source file are pre-packaged for you.
The following command will download the change set and apply it to the project:

<blockquote>
<tt>user$ <b>aedist -rec -f
    <a href="eg_oss_begin.ae">
    http://aegis.sourceforge.net/eg_oss_begin.ae</a>
    -p vgrabbj -c 900 -v</b><br>
user$</tt>
</blockquote>

The change set is applied to the trunk of the project branch tree (the
project name doesn't end with <tt>.0.9</tt>) because files are inherited
by sub-branches, and most of these settings will not be changing.
<p>
It's worth mentioning that the Aegis project configuration
established by this change set consists of five files:
<dl>
<dt><tt>aegis.conf</tt><dd>
    This file contains the directive that all files in the
    <tt>aegis.conf.d</tt> directory are to be read for additional
    configuration information.
<dt><tt>aegis.conf.d/build</tt><dd>
    This file says how to build the project.
    Initial it is set to &ldquo;<tt>exit 0</tt>&rdquo;
    to indicate no build is required.  This will be addressed shortly.
<dt><tt>aegis.conf.d/diff</tt><dd>
    This file sets GNU Diff as the file difference tool.
<dt><tt>aegis.conf.d/merge</tt><dd>
    This file sets RCS Merge as the file difference tool.
    It won't be used in this example, but at some point all projects
    will need it.
<dt><tt>aegis.conf.d/history</tt><dd>
    This file sets the history tool to be used.  For this example, the
    <i>aesvt</i>(1) program, which comes with Aegis, is used.  There
    are example configurations included with the Aegis distribution for
    SCCS, RCS and FHist; this example is the wrong place to explore all
    of these alternatives. <b>Note:</b> you can <i>not</i> change the
    choice of history tool later, you must get the history tool right
    in the first change set; practice on little examples first, before
    migrating a serious project.  The History Tool chapter of the Aegis
    <a href="user-guide.pdf">User Guide</a> has more information about
    the various history tools.
</dl>
<p>
This change will automatically end development, and you need to
integrate it.  This is because Aegis breaks the commit step into several
separate stages, each with its own checks and balances.
<p>
The integration step, particularly when it is not being used as a second
review stage, is most simply accomplished using the <tt>aeintegratq</tt>
command:

<blockquote>
<pre>user$ <b>aeintegratq vgrabbj</b>
user$</pre>
</blockquote>

It will take about a minute, and it won't say much if nothing went wrong.
<p>
At this point, many Aegis commands are available, and you may like to
try some if them out.
<dl>
<dt><tt>ael p</tt><dd>
    List the projects.  This show all the projects that Aegis is managing.
<dt><tt>ael c</tt><dd>
    List the changes.  This will show change 0 (branch 0, branches are
    just big change sets), and change 900 which was used to add the
    project configuration files.
<dt><tt>aecd -bl</tt><dd>
    Change directory to the project baseline.
    Take a look around using <i>ls</i>(1) and <i>vi</i>(1).
    You can't break anything - you don't have write permission.
</dl>
The Aegis <a href="refman.pdf">Reference Manual</a> would be very useful
to you at this point, because you can look up each of these commands,
and discover the wealth of command line options not mentioned in the
above examples.

<h2>Creating a New Project from Scratch</h2>

I know this example is about an existing project, but if you are
creating a new project from scratch, you will probably be interested in
the GNU Auto Tools change set, which establishes the build system for an
empty project.

<blockquote>
<tt>user$ <b>aedist -rec -f
    <a href="eg_oss_aemak.ae">
    http://aegis.sourceforge.net/eg_oss_aemak.ae</a>
    -p vgrabbj -c 6 -v</b><br>
user$</tt>
</blockquote>

This project uses Automake, Autoconf and Libtool to do all the work.
All you have to do is conform to the pretty relaxed expectations in
<i>aemakegen</i>(1) of the project directory layout.
<p>
Skip this section if you are working with an existing project.  Skip
down to section &ldquo;<i> Template Contents for New Files</i>&rdquo; if
you are starting from scratch.

<h2>Unpacking the Tarball into a Change Set</h2>

Now we are ready to actually take some OSS code and commit into our
shiny new repository.
<p>
You need to visit <tt><a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/vgrabbj/"
>vgrabbj.sourceforge.net</a></tt> and download the
latest tarball.  This example is based on 0.9.6, but it will not matter
very much of the minor version has moved on since this was written.
<p>
We created branches <tt>0</tt> and <tt>0.9</tt> before, and now we are
going to use them.

<blockquote>
<pre>user$ <b>ae_p vgrabbj.0.9</b>
user$</pre>
</blockquote>

This command sets the <tt>AEGIS_PROJECT</tt> environment variable, so
you don't have to keep typing <tt>--project=vgrabbj.0.9</tt> all the time.
<p>
Assuming that the tarball is in the current directory, the following
command will unpack it into a change set:

<blockquote>
<tt>user$ <b>aetar --receive -f vgrabbj-0.9.6.tar.gz -c 6
    --exclude-auto-tools --remove-path-prefix=1</b><br>
</tt><i>...lots of output...</i><tt><br>
user$</tt>
</blockquote>

The <tt>--exclude-auto-tools</tt> option says to exclude common
non-source files (like <tt>./configure</tt>) from the tarball
if <i>aetar</i> detects the presence of their precursors (like
<tt>configure.ac</tt>).  These files will be created by the build
system, which will be introduced in the next section.
(This option can be abbreviated to <tt>-eat</tt>.)
<p>
The <tt>--remove -path-prefix=1</tt> option says to remove the top-level
directory from the filenames in the tarball.  It changes with every
version, and thus is not helpful when you want to track upstream
versions.
(This option can be abbreviated to <tt>-rpp=1</tt>.)
<p>
If you read the output of this command (scroll up your terminal window)
you can see all of the commands <i>aetar</i>(1) executed for you.
Each of the files in the tarball has been created as a source file.
<p>
You will also see that it created a private work area for you to do this
within, inside you home directory, called a development directory.
Every change set gets its own development directory.
You can enter this development directory and have a look around using the
following command:

<blockquote>
<pre>user$ <b>aecd 6</b>
user$ <b>ls -l</b>
user$</pre>
</blockquote>

That &ldquo;6&rdquo; is the change set number.  It was specified
explicitly on the <i>aetar</i>(1) command line, so that it matches the
tarball.  If you don't specify a number, the <i>aetar</i>(1) command will
use the next available.
<p>
There are a number of other Aegis command which now have some
content.  Try

<blockquote>
<pre>user$ <b>ael cd</b>
user$</pre>
</blockquote>

The &ldquo;cd&rdquo; is short for <i>change-details</i> and much faster
to type than the long version, though that also works.
<p>
You will see that the change description isn't especially informative.
You can use the following command to edit the change set's attributes:

<blockquote>
<pre>user$ <b>tkaeca</b>
user$</pre>
</blockquote>

Just change the descriptions for now, and resist the urge to kick the
tires.  You can always create another change set later.
<p>
<b>Note:</b> if you aren't using X11, the <i>aeca</i>(1) command will
does the same job, and it's what <i>tkaeca</i>(1) invokes, but you
will need to read the <i>aecattr</i>(5) man page for the expected input
format.  For novices, the GUI interface is easier.
<p>
To finish this change set, it's much like the previous one.  All of
the usual Aegis process will be adhered to (if you consult the <a
href="user-guide.pdf" >User Guide</a> you will see what that means) but it
will go by very quickly in this example.

<blockquote>
<pre>user$ <b>aefinish</b>
<i>...lots of output...</i>
user$ <b>cd</b>
user$ <b>aeintegratq vgrabbj-0.9</b>
user$</pre>
</blockquote>

At this point, the most recent upstream version is in your Aegis
repository.  You can do what you like from now, but the next section
gets it to build, so that you can start using some of Aegis more
advanced software development process features.

<h2>Adding the Build to the Development Environment</h2>

The development process modeled by Aegis can be used to enforce policy
such as &ldquo;change sets must build successfully before they are
committed&rdquo;.  In order to accomplish this policy, Aegis watches the
exit status of the build command.  You can use just about any build tool
you like, but many OSS projects use GNU Make, and <tt>vgrabbj</tt> is no
exception.
<p>
There is a second pre-packaged Aegis change set which you can use to
have your project be built under Aegis, and enforce such a build policy.
<p>
This change set, which you will download very soon, does another thing,
as well: it sets the development directory style.  Many OSS developers
are used to CVS or SVN which make a complete copy of the project when
you check out your private work area.  And their build systems are based
on the assumption that this has happened.  Aegis is able to provide
this kind of development directory style, however the default is a
&ldquo;view path&rdquo; style which only has source files in the private
work area if they are actually being changed, which can get confusing
for new users who are expecting a fully populated source tree.

<blockquote>
<tt>user$ <b>aedist -rec -f
    <a href="eg_oss_build.ae">http://aegis.sourceforge.net/eg_oss_build.ae</a>
    -p vgrabbj.0.9 -c 901 -v -trojan</b><br>
</tt><i>...lots of output...</i><tt><br>
user$</tt>
</blockquote>

This command downloads the change set, creates a private work area for
it (called a development directory in Aegis speak) and unpacks all the
files of the change set into it.
<p>
The <tt>-trojan</tt> option says to stop once the files are unpacked,
and before any builds occur.  You can do this for remote changes you
are not sure about, but it also gives you a chance to poke about the
development directory and see what Aegis has actually done.

<blockquote>
<pre>user$ <b>aecd 901</b>
user$ <b>ls</b>
user$</pre>
</blockquote>

The first thing you will want to know is &ldquo;where have all the
source files gone?&rdquo;  Remember the view path thing?  The development
directory style just downloaded hasn't taken effect yet.
The build will take care of that, and we will get to it shortly.
<p>
It is worth taking a look at the files about to be created by this
change set.  The <tt>aegis.conf.d/build</tt> file tells Aegis how the
project is built.  It invokes <i>make</i>(1) with a special makefile
which includes the generated <tt>Makefile</tt>, if it exists, and builds
it if it does not (in which case it builds it and starts again).  In
this way, the build is boot-strapped without altering any of the source
files we got from the tarball.
<p>
To build, you just need this command:

<blockquote>
<tt>user$ <b>aeb</b><br>
<i>...lots of output...</i><br>
user$</tt>
</blockquote>

If you look at the output (scroll the terminal back) you will see
that all of the usual and expected things are done to build an OSS
project.  You will also note that the development directory is now full
of source files... this is because the <i>aeb</i>(1) command updated
the development directory automatically before running the configured
build command.  After this change set is integrated, the next time you
start a new change set, the development directory will be populated
immediately.
<p>
If there are any problems with the build, it is going to be with how the
project uses GNU Autoconf and GNU Automake to bootstrap itself.  You
may need to edit the <tt>aegis.supplementary/makefile</tt> file to fix
the problem.  Once the &ldquo;real&rdquo; <tt>Makefile</tt> has been
produced, the supplementary file will do nothing.
<p>
We will finish this change set the same way as before, using the
<i>aefinish</i>(1) command, and then integrate it:

<blockquote>
<pre>user$ <b>aefinish</b>
<i>...lots of output...</i>
user$ <b>cd</b>
user$ <b>aeintegratq vgrabbj-0.9</b>
user$</pre>
</blockquote>

And now the project builds.  This would be a good time to read through
the worked example in the Aegis <a href="user-guide.pdf">User Guide</a>.

<h2>Template Contents for New Files</h2>

One of the useful features of Aegis is the ability to provide templated
contents for new files.  There is a pre-built change set you can
download which will provide GPL headers for all of your new files.

<blockquote>
<tt>user$ <b>aedist -rec -f
    <a href="eg_oss_templ.ae">http://aegis.sourceforge.net/eg_oss_templ.ae</a>
    -p vgrabbj.0.9 -c 902 -v</b><br>
user$</tt>
</blockquote>

This change set is finished in the usual way.

<blockquote>
<pre>user$ <b>aefinish</b>
user$ <b>cd</b>
user$ <b>aeintegratq vgrabbj-0.9</b>
user$</pre>
</blockquote>

This change set also includes a new file template for new tests.  You
create a new test with the <i>aent</i>(1) command, from within a
change set in the <i>being developed</i> state.

<h2>All Done</h2>

At this point your project is ready to go.  You can create a new change
set, begin development, write a test, and start bug fixing and/or adding
new functionality.

A couple of tips:
<ul><li>
    One bug, one change set.  Aegis keeps track of what source files are
    associated with what tests, this is how the <i>aet --suggest</i> command
    knows what to suggest.  If you fix lots of things in a single change set,
    the suggestions aren't as good.
<li>
    New change sets and their work areas are cheap to produce.  You can
    have more than one going at a time, which makes the &ldquo;one bug, cone
    change set&rdquo; suggestion practical.
<li>
    Consider writing the tests first (<a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_driven_development"
    >Test Driven Development</a>).
    The new file templates do most of the hard work, you just have to
    fill in the gap where something is actually tested.
</ul>
