# MANIFEST: German localization
#
# See also lib/de/LC_MESSAGES/glossary for common terms to be used
# for consistent error message presentation.
#
# Just A Few Notes...
#
# 	When translating these error messages, all of the substitutions
# 	described in aesub(5) are also available.  Substitution variable
# 	names and function names may be abbreviated, in the same way
# 	that command line options are abbreviated, but abbreviation
# 	should probably be avoided.
#
# 	While Aegis was written by an English speaker, this English
# 	localization file is necessary, to translate the ``terse
# 	programmer'' style error messages into something more user
# 	friendly.
#
# 	Messages which include state names need to leave the state names
# 	untranslated, because they will probably never be translated.
#
# 	Messages which include command line options need to leave them
# 	untranslated, because they are not yet internationalized, though
# 	they will be one day.
#
# 	The list names (known to ael) have not been internationalized (yet).
#
# 	Substitution names will Never be internationalized.
# 	Otherwise the substitutions will stop working, Catch-22.
#
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The presence of the "#, fuzzy" flag is an indication that the error
