# This file was generated using an automatics translator on the Internet.
# If you are a native Spanish speaker, improvements to this file would
# be most greatfully received.
#
# Just A Few Notes...
#
#       When translating these error messages, all of the substitutions
#       described in aesub(5) are also available.  Substitution variable
#       names and function names may be abbreviated, in the same way
#       that command line options are abbreviated, but abbreviation
#       should probably be avoided.
#
#       While Aegis was written by an English speaker, this English
#       localization file is necessary, to translate the "terse
#       programmer" style error messages into something more user
#       friendly.
#
#       Messages which include state names need to leave the state names
#       untranslated, because they will probably never be translated.
#
#       Messages which include command line options need to leave them
#       untranslated, because they are not yet internationalized, though
#       they will be one day.
#
#       The list names (known to ael) have not been internationalized (yet).
#
#       Substitution names will Never be internationalized.
#       Otherwise the substitutions will stop working, Catch-22.
#
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The presence of the "#, fuzzy" flag is an indication that the error
# message needs to be (re)translated.
