 * MANIFEST: example of using sccs in the project config file
 *
 * The entries for the commands are listed below.  SCCS uses a slightly
 * different model than aegis wants, so some maneuvering is required.  The
 * command strings in this section assume that the SCCS commands admin and get
 * and delta are in the command search PATH, but you may like to hard-wire the
 * paths, or set PATH at the start of each.  You should also note that the
 * strings are always handed to the Bourne shell to be executed, and are set to
 * exit with an error immediately a sub-command fails.
