 * MANIFEST: example architecture definitions for the project config file
 *
 * Delete those entries which you do not want to enforce.
 * Additions to this file are most welcome.
 *
 * Remember, if you use heterogeneous development, you will need to pass the
 * architecture to the build_command, and you will need to extensively re-write
 * the DMT rules.  Aegis expects that the development directory and the
 * baseline contains object files and executables for all architectures
 * simultaneously.
