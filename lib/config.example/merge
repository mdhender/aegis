/*
 * Compare three files using merge(1).  Conflicts are marked in the output.
 *
 * This command is used by aed(1) to produce a difference listing when a file
 * in the development directory is out of date compared to the current version
 * in the baseline.
 *
 * All of the command substitutions described in aesub(5) are available.
 * In addition, the following substitutions are also available:
 *
 * ${ORiginal}
 *	The absolute path name of a file containing the common ancestor
 *	version of ${MostRecent} and {$Input}.  Usually the version originally
 *	copied into the change.  Usually in a temporary file.
 * ${Most_Recent}
 *	The absolute path name of a file containing the most recent version.
 *	Usually in the baseline.
 * ${Input}
 *	The absolute path name of the edited version of the file.  Usually in
 *	the development directory.
 * ${Output}
 *	The absolute path name of the file in which to write the difference
 *	listing.  Usually in the development directory.
 *
 * An exit status of 0 means successful, even of the files differ (and they
 * usually do).  An exit status which is non-zero means something is wrong.
 *
 * The "merge -L" options are used to specify labels for the baseline and the
 *	development directory, respectively, when conflict lines are inserted
 *	into the result.
 * The "merge -p" options is used to specify that the results are to be printed
 *	on the standard output.
