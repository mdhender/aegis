 * MANIFEST: example use of fhist in the project config file
 *
 * The fhist program was written by David I. Bell and is admirably
 * suited to providing a history mechanism with out the "cruft" that
 * SCCS and RCS impose.  The fhist program also comes with two other
 * utilities, fcomp and fmerge, which use the same minimal difference
 * algorithm.
 *
 * Please note that the [# edit #] feature needs to be avoided, or the
 * -Fored_Update (-fu) flag needs to be used in addition to the
 * -Conditional_Update (-cu) flag, otherwise updates will complain that
 * ``Input file "XXX" contains edit A instead of B for module "YYY"''
 *
 * The history_create_command and the history_put_command are
 * intentionally identical.  This minimizes problems when using
 * branches.
 *
 * The ${quote ...} construct is used to quote filesnames whicg contain
 * shell special characters.  A minimum of quoting is performed, so if
 * the filenames do not contail shell special characters, no quotes will
 * be used.

 * An exit status of 0 means successful, even of the files differ (and
 * they usually do).  An exit status which is non-zero means something
