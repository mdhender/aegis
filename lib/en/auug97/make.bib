%P 422-423
%Z Abstract:
%Z In the current Computer Aided Software Engineering
%Z (CASE), most software development activities can be
%Z automated with software tools to help the software
%Z developers and system integartors manage their software
%Z products and development environment. For example,
%Z UNIX/RCS and MAKE are among the most widely used tools
%Z in the UNIX community. Although these tools support
%Z specific software life cycle phases, software
%Z developers still need to take the output of one phase
%Z and manually input it to the next phase for further
%Z development. Even tools used within the same life cycle
%Z phase do not necessarily communicate with each other.
%Z 'Information Sharing' is extremely important for a
%Z software development environment to provide the
%Z transparent data access across various software life
%Z cycle phases and software tools efficiently. In this
%Z paper, generic requirements for a CASE database based
%Z on the study from a 'programming in the large'
%Z environment in Hewlett-Packard which involves the
%Z interaction of thousands of software developers and
%Z million lines of source code and other related design
%Z objects are presented.
