.SH Description:
Aegis is a transaction-based software configuration management system.
It provides a framework within which
a team of developers may work on many changes to a
program independently, and Aegis coordinates integrating
these changes back into the master source of the program,
with as little disruption as possible.
.sp
Aegis supports geographically distributed development.  A very flexible
mechanism is provided which may be used to keep two or more repositories
synchronized.
.sp
Aegis runs on almost any flavor of UNIX.
Self configuring using a script generated by GNU Autoconf.
There are no modifications required to compile it for Linux.
.SH Keywords:
transaction based software configuration management,
