.nh 1 "Cheat Sheet"
.LP
This page is a quick reference into the common Aegis commands.
.IP \(bu 2n
Usually, \[lq]\f[CW]man\fP \fIcommand_name\fP\[rq] can be used to get
more details
on a particular command.
.IP \(bu 2n
See also the official Aegis quick reference in the User Guide, page 88.
.IP \(bu 2n
The \[lq]\f[CW]-p\fP \fIname\fP\[rq] option is used to specify the project name.
.IP \(bu 2n
The \[lq]\f[CW]-c\fP \fInumber\fP\[rq] option is used to specify the
change number.
.IP \(bu 2n
The \[lq]\f[CW]-l\fP\[rq] (or \[lq]\f[CW]-List\fP\[rq]) option can often
be used to
list subjects for the given command (eg. change numbers or projects) or
simply to list rather than edit (\fIe.g.\fP a file or change attributes).
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------------
.nh 2 "Common Commands"
.IP "\f[CW]ae_p\fP \fIproject-name.branch-number\fP" 8n
Set current project number for all following Aegis commands.  The
\f[CW]ae_p\fP command with no arguments will `unset' this forced default.
.IP "\f[CW]ae_c\fP \fInumber\fP" 8n
Set current change number for all following Aegis commands.  The
\f[CW]ae_c\fP command with no arguments will `unset' this forced default.
.IP "\f[CW]aecd\fP [ \f[CW]-bl\fP ]" 8n
Change directory [change to baseline].
.IP "\f[CW]aeb\fP"
Aegis build - used by developers, reviewers and/ or integrators.
.IP "\f[CW]aet\fP"
Run tests - used by developers.
.IP "\f[CW]aed\fP"
Difference of change files with baseline.
.IP "\f[CW]aedless\fP"
View difference files generated with \f[CW]aed\fP.
.IP "\f[CW]ael cd\fP"
List change details.
.IP "\f[CW]aeca\fP [ \f[CW]-l\fP ]"
Edit [list] change attributes.
.IP "\f[CW]tkaenc\fP"
Create a new change (see \fIaenc\fP(1) for details),
using a GUI interface.
This makes it a damn sight easier to type in the description field.
.IP "\f[CW]tkaeca\fP"
Edit change attributes (see \fIaeca\fP(1) for details),
using a GUI interface.
This makes it a damn sight easier to edit the description field.
.IP "\f[CW]ael ll\fP"
List all of the lists (there are a lot).
.IP "\f[CW]ael c\fP"
List all of the changes for a project (branch).
.IP "\f[CW]ael cf\fP"
List all of the files in a change.
.IP "\fIaeuconf\fP(5)"
This is a man page documenting the \f[CW]~/.aegisrc\fP file format.

.nh 2 "Developer Commands"
.LP
Procedure:
\f[CW]ael cd\fP \(->
\f[CW]aedb\fP \(->
\fIdo stuff\fP \(->
\f[CW]aeb\fP \(->
\f[CW]aet\fP \(->
\f[CW]aed\fP \(->
\f[CW]aedless\fP [ \(->
\f[CW]aeclean\fP ] \(->
\f[CW]aede\fP
.IP "\f[CW]aedb[u]\fP"
Develop begin [undo].
.IP "\f[CW]aede[u]\fP"
Develop end [undo].
.IP "\f[CW]aeclean\fP"
This will remove all files in the development directory which are not in
the change as new files or copied files.
This may delete files that you want, so be careful.
.LP
The \fIaeclean\fP(1) command uses Aegis' knowledge of what is
\fIsupposed\fP to be in the change.  You are meant to tell Aegis about
all source files you create in a development directory.  If you have
forgotten to do this, it is highly likely that the integration would
fail in any case.
.LP
If you are importing files from elsewhere, use \[lq]\fIaenf .\fP\[rq] and all
of the files in the directory tree below dot (the current directory)
will be added to the change (make sure there are no object files when
you do this).
.IP "\f[CW]aecp\fP"
Prepares a file in the project for editing within the change; \fIi.e.\fP copy
file into change from baseline.  Remove symlink if necessary, etc.
.IP "\f[CW]aecpu\fP"
Reverse the effects of the above.
.IP "\f[CW]aecpu -unch\fP"
Will check all files in your change to see if any
have not been modified, and perform an \fIaecpu\fP on them.  This will stop
an unnecessary version number increment for files that have not changed.
(And also improves test correlations.)
.IP "\f[CW]aem\fP"
Merge out-of-date files.
See the \fI-Only-merge\fP option of the \fIaed\fP(1) command.
.IP "\f[CW]aenf[u]\fP"
Create/ add a new file [undo].
.IP "\f[CW]aemv\fP"
Rename (move) files.
.IP "\f[CW]aerm[u]\fP"
This tells Aegis the file is to be removed from the baseline when the
change is integrated.  Or \fIaermu\fP to undo this \fIbefore\fP the
change is finished.

.nh 2 "Reviewer Commands"
.LP
Procedure:
\f[CW]ael cd\fP \(->
\f[CW]aecd\fP \(->
\f[CW]aedless\fP \(->
\fIview output, review source files\fP ->
\f[CW]aerpass\fP
.LP
Remember: the point of reviews is to find problems, not be a rubber stamp.
You are expected to fail some reviews.
.IP "\f[CW]aerpass\fP"
Review pass.
.IP "\f[CW]aerpu\fP"
Review pass undo.
.IP "\f[CW]aerfail\fP"
Review fail.
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------------
.nh 2 "Integrator Commands"
.LP
Procedure:
\f[CW]aeib\fP \(->
\f[CW]aeb\fP \(->
\f[CW]aet\fP \(->
\f[CW]aed\fP \(->
\f[CW]aeipass\fP
.LP
There is an \fIaeintegratq\fP(1) script distributed with Aegis to do
this procedure automatically.
.IP "\f[CW]aeib[u]\fP"
Integrate begin [undo].
.IP "\f[CW]aeipass\fP"
Integrate pass.
.IP "\f[CW]aeifail\fP"
Integrate fail.
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------------
.nh 2 "Project Administrator Commands"
.LP
This includes all of the commands that don't fit the categories above.
.IP "\f[CW]aenc[u]\fP"
Create a new change [undo].
See \fIaecattr\fP(5) for description of file format,
or use \fItkaenc\fP(1) instead.
.IP "\f[CW]aend\fP and \f[CW]aerd\fP"
New developer; remove developer.
.IP "\f[CW]aenrv\fP and \f[CW]aerrv\fP"
New reviewer; remover reviewer.
.IP "\f[CW]aeni\fP and \f[CW]aeri\fP"
New integrator; remove integrator.
.IP "\f[CW]aena\fP and \f[CW]aera\fP"
New (project) administrator; remove administrator.
.IP "\f[CW]aepa [-l]\fP"
Edit [list] project attributes (see \fIaepattr\fP(5) for file format).
.IP "\f[CW]aeca [-l]\fP"
Edit [list] change attributes (see \fIaecattr\fP(5) for file format).
.IP "\f[CW]tkaeca\fP"
Edit change attributes using a GUI.
This makes it much easier to type in the description field.
