.nh 1 "How to Start Using Aegis"
.LP
For the first\[hy]time user, Aegis can appear to be very daunting.
It has a huge number of configuration alternatives for each project,
and it is difficult to know where to begin.
.LP
It is assumed that you already have Aegis installed.  If you do not, see
the section of the \fIReference Manual\fP called \fIThe BUILDING File\fP.
This reproduces the \f[CW]BUILDING\fP file included in the Aegis source
distribution.
.\" -----------------------------------------------------------------------
.nh 2 "First, Create The Project"
.LP
You need to create a new project.  Follow the instructions in the \fIHow
to Create a New Project\fP section, and then return here.
.\" -----------------------------------------------------------------------
.nh 2 "Second, Use a Template Project"
.LP
The very first time you use Aegis, it will be easiest if you download
one of the template projects.  This gives you a project which (almost
always) works correctly the first time \[lq]out of the box\[rq].
.IP \(bu 2n
The template projects can be found on the Aegis home page:
.\" do not warn "cannot adjust line"
.warn (\n[.warn]-(((\n[.warn]/4)%2)*4))
\f[CW]http://aegis.sourceforge.net/\fP
.IP \(bu 2n
If you are a long\[hy]time GNU Make user, you probably want the Make\[hy]RCS
template, at least to start with.
.IP \(bu 2n
Follow the instructions found on the web page
and you will have a working Aegis project, complete with self tests.
.IP \(bu 2n
From this starting point, create changes (the \fItkaenc\fP command is good
for this, as it gives you a simple GUI) and try modifying the calculator,
or adding more programs to the project.
.IP \(bu 2n
The template projects is intended to be generally useful.  Many users
have simply retained this format and inserted their own projects into it.
(Use a change to delete the calculator and its tests.)
.\" -----------------------------------------------------------------------
.nh 2 "Second, Copy a Template Project"
.LP
If this isn't the very first time, you may wish to get more adventurous,
and try copying the relevant bits out of a working project.  Usually,
when sites first try this, the working project will be one of the template
projects from the previous section.
.IP \(bu 2n
Create a new project.
For this exercise, you probably want a single user project.
.IP \(bu 2n
Create a new change
.IP \(bu 2n
Copy the project \fIconfig\fP file, and and files referenced by it, such
as the new file templates and the build configuration file (\fIMakefile\fP
or \fIHowto.cook\fP, depending).
.IP \(bu 2n
Copy the sources of the existing project into the development directory.
If you have several levels of directories, reproduce this, too.
.IP \(bu 2n
Remove files which are not primary sources (\fIe.g.\fP the generated C
sources of you have yacc input files).
.IP \(bu 2n
Using the \[lq]\fIaenf \&.\fP\[rq] command (yes, that's a dot, meaning \[lq]the
current directory\[rq]) you can tell Aegis to add all of the source files
in the development directory to the change set.
.IP \(bu 2n
You will probably need to modify your build method to meet
Aegis' expectations.  Rather than do this immediately, change
the \fIbuild_command\fP in the project \fIconfig\fP file to read
\[lq]\f[CW]build_command = "exit 0";\fP\[rq] and fix it in the next change set.
.IP \(bu 2n
Now, build, develop end, review and integrate, as found in the
\fIUser Guide\fP worked example.  (Except, of course, there is only one
member of staff.)
.IP \(bu 2n
Create a second change, and copy the project configuration file (called
\fIaegis.conf\fP by default), and the
build configuration file (probably \fIMakefile\fP or \fIHowto.cook\fP)
into the change.
.IP \(bu 2n
This would be a good time to read the \fIDependency Maintenance Tool\fP
chapter of the Aegis User Guide, and also \fIRecursive Make Considered
Harmful\fP (see the author's web site) if you haven't already.
.IP \(bu 2n
Edit the build configuration, try the \fIaeb\fP command;
it will probably fail.
Iterate until things build correctly.
.IP \(bu 2n
develop end, review and integrate as normal.
Your project is now under Aegis.
