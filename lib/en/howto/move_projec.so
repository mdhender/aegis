.nh 1 "How to Move a Project"
.LP
By "move a project", you may wish to change the project's name but
leave the project files in the same location, or you may wish to
change a projects directory location and leave it with the same name.
This section covers both.
.LP
There are two ways to move a project.  One is from within Aegis,
and one is from outside Aegis.
Each section below covers both methods.
.nh 2 "Relocating a Project"
.LP
This section deals with moving a project's files from one filesystem
location to another.
.nh 3 "From within Aegis"
.LP
This works best when you are moving a project from one machine to another.
It is a \fIvery\fP good idea if there are no active changes on \fIany\fP branch.
.LP
Step 1: You need to know where in the file system the project currently
resides.  Take a look in the projects list (\fIael p\fP) and see the
directory reported for the trunk of the project.  Ignore any active
branches.
.LP
Step 2: Usually, when you remove a project, Aegis deleted all of the project
files.  However the aerm \-keep option tells Aegis to remove the project
name, but keep all of the project files.
.LP
Step 3: Move the files to their new location, you need \fIall\fP of the files
below the directory tree you found in step 1.  This may be a simple
file move, or may involve copying the files to tape, and then
unpacking on a new machine.  Remember to make sure the file ownerships
are set the way you want (usually, this means "preserved exactly").
.LP
Step 4: Tell Aegis where the project is.  To do this, use the \-dir
and \-keep options of the \fIaenpr\fP(1) command.
.nh 3 "From outside Aegis"
.LP
This works best of the project is staying on the same machine, or
the same NFS network.
.LP
Step 1: You need to know where in the file system the project currently
resides.  Take a look in the projects list (ael p) and see the
directory reported for the trunk of the project.  Ignore any active
branches.
.LP
Step 2: Move the files to the new location.
.LP
Step 3: Edit the \*(S)/state file and edit the path
appropriately to tell Aegis where you moved the files to.
You will need to be root for this step.
.nh 2 "Renaming a Project"
.LP
This section deals with changing a project's name without moving is files.
.nh 3 "From within Aegis"
.LP
Step 1: You need to know where in the file system the project currently
resides.  Take a look in the projects list (\fIael p\fP) and see the
directory reported for the trunk of the project.  Ignore any active
branches.
.LP
Step 2: Usually, when you remove a project, Aegis deleted all of the
project files.  However the aerm \-keep option tells Aegis to remove
the project name, but keep all of the project files.
.LP
Step 3: Tell Aegis where the project is, using the new name.  To do this,
use the \-dir and \-keep options of the \fIaenpr\fP(1) command.
.nh 3 "From outside Aegis"
.LP
Step 1: Edit the \*(S)/state file and edit the name
appropriately to tell Aegis the new name of the project.
You will need to be root for this step.
.nh 3 "Project Aliases"
.LP
You may need some transition time for your developers.  Either before or
after you rename the project, you may want to consider adding a project
alias (see \fIaenpa\fP(1) for more information) so that the project has
"both" names for a while.
