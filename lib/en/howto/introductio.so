.nh 1 "Introduction"
.LP
This manual contains a series of brief lessons or ``How To'' guides for
using Aegis.  Each is arranged to cover two pages, so that when the manual
lies open on the desk, the whole subject is easily visable in front of you.
.LP
When printing this manual, it is essential to print it double sided,
or the ``subject at once'' effect will not occur.
.LP
The table of contents will be printed last.
Insert it (there should be two pages, on one sheet of paper) before this page.
.nh 2 "Assumed Knowledge"
.LP
Many of thes sections are written for use by beginners, so there is a
fairly low level of assumed knowledge.  However, you may want to have
\fIThe Aegis User Guide\fP, and \fIThe Aegis Reference Manual\fP very
close by, as all of the material convered here is available in a more
expended or detailed form on those manuals.
.nh 2 "Howto Install Aegis"
.LP
The description of how to build, test and install Aegis may be found
in the Reference Manual, under the heading \fIThe BUILDING File\fP,
which reproduces the \f[CW]BUILDING\fP file included in the Aegis source
distribution.
.LP
If you installed Aegis using a RedHat or Debian package, this will not
be at all relevant to you, simply ignore it.
.nh 2 "Howto Contribute"
.LP
If you would like to see other ``How To'' subjects, please drop me an e-mail.
Better yet, write one and e-mail it to me.
