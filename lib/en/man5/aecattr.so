.br
This field contains a brief description of the change.
.TP 8n
cause = ( ... );
.br
This field describes the cause which motivated the change.
.RS 8n
.TP 8n

a bug report
from outside the development team.
This repairs existing functionality.

The change was created in response to
an enhancement request
from outside the development team.
This adds new functionality.

.TP 8n
chain
.br
This cause is where you have a fix to fix a fix;
tracking these is an interesting quality metric.
.RE
.TP 8n
test_exempt = boolean;
.br
This field is true if it is not necessary
to test the change.
It is, in general, desirable to test all changes,
whether new functionality or a bug fix.
This is, however, a project management issue.
.TP 8n
test_baseline_exempt = boolean;
.br
This field is true if it is not necessary
to test the change against the baseline before it is changed.
The test of the baseline is required to fail;
this is to establish that the test has isolated the bug,
and that the change has fixed that isolated bug.
.TP 8n
regression_test_exempt = boolean;
.br
This field is true if it is not necessary
to perform a full regression test on the change.
If absent, defaults to true for all causes except improvements.
.TP 8n
architecture = [ string ];
.br
This field is a list of names of
system and machine architectures on which the change
must successfully build and test.
.TP 8n
copyright_years = [ integer ];
.RS
This field details the years in which the change was worked on.
This field is present in trunk, branch and leaf nodes.
.PP
As a change is edited, years in which the change was worked on
accumulate in this field automatically.
Branches accumulate years as integrations occur.
You may need to manually edit this,
though it should be rare.
.RE
.TP 8n
version_previous = string;
This field records the "previous" version, mostly to simplify patch generation.
It is only meaningful for trunks and branches.
It is set automatically when a branch is started or integrated.
.TP 8n
attribute = [ { ... } ];
.RS
This is a list of \fI(name,value)\fP pairs, defining user specified attributes.
.TP 8n
name = string;
.RS
The name of the attribute.
By convention, names which start with an upper-case letter will appear
in listings, and lower-case will not.
Attribute names are case-insensitive.
.RE
.TP 8n
value = string;
The value of the attribute.
.PP
Arguably, most change attributes which may be altered by the user (and
some that can't) should be of this form.  Due to an accident of history,
this is not the case.
