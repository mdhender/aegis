.TP 8n
metrics = [ { ... } ];
.RS
This field is used to
describe various file metrics.
It is committed during
.IR aeipass (1),
when the file is added to the history.
The name must be given, and exactly one value.
.TP 8n
name = string;
This is the name of the metric.
This field must be set.
.TP 8n
value = real;
This is the value of the metric.
This field must be set.
(If you have an integer-valued metric, just use integers, Aegis will cope.
If you have a string-valued metric, assign integers to the enumerands.)
