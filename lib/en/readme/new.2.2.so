.SS Version 2.2
.PP
This release of Aegis provides 3 of the most commonly requested features:
support for heterogeneous development,
support for a greater range of DMTs,
support for user-defined reports.
.PP
.if t \(bu
.if n *
Aegis now supports heterogeneous development.
Now you can be sure that your project not only always
builds and tests sucessfully,
but that
it does so across a configurable set of system or hardware architectures.
See the
.I "Heterogeneous Development"
secion of the
.I "Tips and Traps"
chapter of the User Guide for more information.
.PP
.if t \(bu
.if n *
Aegis can now cope with a wider range of Dependency Maintenance Tools (DMTs).
It now has the ability to fill development directories with
symbolic links to all files in the baseline which are not
present in the development directory.
This allows DMTs to assume all files are present below the current directory,
allowing DMTs such as
.I cake
and
.I "GNU Make"
to be used.
See the
.I "Dependency Maintenance Tool"
section of the User Guide and
.IR aeb (1)
for more information.
.PP
.if t \(bu
.if n *
Aegis now has a report generator,
so you can create your own reports.
Many "canned" reports are included in this distribution;
of particular interest to many will be the
.I "File_\%Activity"
report,
which details currently active files.
See
.IR aer (1)
for more information.
.PP
.if t \(bu
.if n *
Aegis is now configured using a shell script called
.IR configure ,
distributed with the package.
This shell script is generated using GNU Autoconf.
See the
.I BUILDING
file for more information.
.PP
.if t \(bu
.if n *
The
.I AEGIS
environment variable has been renamed
.IR AEGIS_PATH ,
to bring it in line with the AEGIS_PROJECT and AEGIS_CHANGE
environment variable names.
The old name will keep working for some time,
but aegis will warn you.
.PP
.if t \(bu
.if n *
Filename lengths are now configurable.
The 14 character portability limit is still the default,
but a higher limit is configurable for each project,
up to the filesystem filename limit.
See
.IR aepconf (5)
for more information.
.PP
.if t \(bu
.if n *
It is now possible to specify that filenames must be
within the minimum character set mandated by POSIX.
The default is as before, to allow any printing character.
See
.IR aepconf (5)
for more information.
.PP
.if t \(bu
.if n *
Limits on the length of project names have been relaxed.
Project names are now only limited by the filesystem filename limit.
.PP
.if t \(bu
.if n *
It is now possible to specify the command to run tests,
allowing a project to use a specialized test facility,
rather than be forced to use shell scripts.
See
.IR aet (1)
and
.IE aepconf (5)
for more information.
.PP
.if t \(bu
.if n *
The commands which accept the
.I -Edit
now preserve the edited text in the event of a failure.
.PP
.if t \(bu
.if n *
The commands which delete files now accept a
.I -Interactive
option,
which causes them to prompt the user for confirmation of file deletion.
This can be made the default by an appropriate setting of the
aliases or individual users preferences files.
See
.IR aenfu (1),
.IR aentu (1),
.IR aecpu (1),
and
.IR aeuconf (5)
for more information.
.PP
.if t \(bu
.if n *
The
.IR aecp (1)
command now accepts directory names,
allowing whole directory trees to be copied into a change.
The
.IR aecpu (1)
command now has a
.B -UNChanged
option which allows the unchanged files to be uncopied.
.PP
.if t \(bu
.if n *
The \fIaeb\fP command now accepts file names,
allowing partial builds to be performed.
See
.IR aeb (1)
for more information.
.PP
.if t \(bu
.if n *
There is a new
.IR aechown (1)
command to facilitate reassigning the developer of a change
which is in the
.I "being developed"
state.
.PP
.if t \(bu
.if n *
It is now possible for project administrators to assign
changes to specific developers.
See
.IR aedb (1)
for more information.
