.\" MANIFEST: document describing new 4.16 features
.\"
.\" ---------- Major New Functionality -------------------------------------
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 119
Each new change set is now assigned a Universally Unique Identifier
(UUID) to allow it to be tracked across geographically distributed
development.  The \fIaedist\fP(1) and \fIaepatch\fP(1) commands now send
the change set UUIDs, and preserve them on receipt.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 175, 162, 159, 151, 136, 120, 118, 117, 116, 115
Each file now has a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) which allows
tracking files across renames, even on geographically separate sites.
(The \fIaedist\fP(1) and \fIaepatch\fP(1) commands send the file UUIDs,
the next release will take advantage of them on receipt.)
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 127, 138, 139, 150
The history filename used to remember file history is now based in
the file UUID, if the file has a UUID.  This simplifies continuity of
history across renames (this fucntion always been present in Aegis, but
harder to access).
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 155
As a consequence of the UUID being used to generate history
file names, there is no longer the restriction that new
files may not be named after the directory portion of a
deleted file (or vice versa).
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 171, 102, 93, 92, 91, 90, 89, 88, 87, 71, 67, 66, 65, 62, 61,
.\" change 52, 31, 28, 27, 19, 18, 16
There is a new \fIaecvsserver\fP(1) command, which presents Aegis
projects and change sets as CVS modules.  All of the core CVS functions
are supported.  This code needs to be exersized and tested by users.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 133, 131, 83, 82, 81, 78, 77, 76, 75, 30
It is now possible to specify arbitrary attribute names and value for
each source file.
The \fIaefa\fP(1) command may be used to edit file attributes.
The \fIaedist\fP(1) and \fIaepatch\fP(1)
send these attributes; a future release will take advantage of the
information on receipt.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 80, 73
It is now possible to attach arbitrary attribute names and values to
change sets.  For example, you can use this to remember the
bugzilla tracking number for a change.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 23
The \fIaepatch\fP(1) command now includes change set meta-data as
a compressed BASE64 encoded block at the top of the patch, after
the human-readable text but before the files.  This means that
\fIaepatch\fP(1) can be as effective as \fIaedist\fP(1) is transmitting
chaneg sets.  Patches without meta-data still work as before.
.\" ---------- Minor New Functionality -------------------------------------
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 153, 152
There is a new report script which writes change logs in Debian format.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 137
The \fIaeget\fP(1) web interface has been improved.  The
\fIaepatch\fP(1) download now accepts \f[CW]compat=\fP\fIN\fP modifier,
and there is a new Project Staff page.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 123
There is a new \fIae-cvs-ci\fP(1) support script which
may be used as an \fIintegrate_\%pass_\%notify_\%command\fP to commit
change sets to CVS in parallel.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 125
There is more documentation in the User Guide about using
GNU Diff, particularly using diff -U to provide whole-file
listings with "change bars" on the left hand side.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 111
The files view of the \fIaeget\fP(1) web interface now accepts
options to control the page contents.  The simplest view
allows recursive fetch of project sources using wget or
similar, with no extraneous links to confuse the results.
Previous behavior is preserved by the aeget-generated
links.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 107, 103, 101
You now receive a warning when you are seeing the short version of the
error messages.  These are terse and often quite cryptic. the long form
of the error messages is to be preferred.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 106
The behaviour of the \fIaedeu\fP(1) command has changed slightly.  When
changes are in the \fIbeing reviewed\fP state, and Aegis has been
configured to use the \fIawaiting review\fP state, the \fIaedeu\fP91)
command will now report an error.  This is so that reviewers don't waste
their time reviewing changes which have already been returned to the
\fIbeing developed\fP state.  Think of the change as "belonging" to the
reviewer while in the \fIbeing reviewed\fP state.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 25
The \fIaedist -send\fP command has a new \fI\-compatibility\fP option,
use to indicate the version of the \fBreceiving\fP aedist program.
This, in turn, selects the features which may be added to or omitted
form the generated \f[CW].ae\fP file.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 35
There is a new \f[CW]config\fP file usage, and a corresponding \fIaenf
\-configure\fP command line option.  It is now possible to move project
configuration files.  It is now possible to remove project configuration
files, provided there is at least one left.  The \fIaeimport\fP(1)
command now avoids files which have the same name as the default project
configuration file ("aegis.conf" or "config") and will use something
else.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 51
The \fIaeipass\fP(1) command now adds a symlink from the delta directory
to the baseline once it has been integrated.  This helps lots of
(idiotic) compilers which insist on burying absolute paths into
executables.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 38
It is now possible to assign to some project configuration
file array fields more than once.  This can be useful where the
configuration file is split into several pieces on several
branches.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 180, 176, 173, 33, 32, 14
The source language has been changed from C to C++.
Future releases will take advantage of this.
.\" ---------- Bug Fixes ---------------------------------------------------
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 172, 15
Several bugs have been fixed in the \fIaeget\fP(1) web interface where
it would display "-42" instead of "0" for changes and branches numbered
zero.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 161, 169
A bug has been fixed in the \fIaed\fP(1) command when merging files
which have been renamed.  It now recognises they need merging.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 44
A bug has been fixed in the \fIaenf\fP(1) command.
It now correctly ignores difference files when given a directory name.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 129
A bug has been fixed in \fIaedist\fP(1) where one of the \fIaegis
\-new-file\fP commands was missing a \fI\-no-template\fP argument.
Under some circumstances, this resulted in change sets which could not
be \fIaedist -receive\fPd.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 121
A bug has been fixed in the way invalid sequences of multi-byte
characters are handled by the internationalization code.  This
potentially affected all reports, listings and error messages.  The
symptom was that aeannotate listings could sometimes have a blank source
code column.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 109
A bug has been fixed in the \fIaepatch\fP(1) command.  It was creating
empty patches for some changes in completed project branches.  This
also affected \fIaedist -send\fP and \fIaecp -delta\fP and \fIaecp
-rescind\fP in some cases.  It was caused by a subtle flaw in the
non-detailed case for the \fIproject_\%file_\%roll_\%forward\fP
function.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 110, 108, 98
A bug has been fixed in the handling of the MANPATH enviromnet variable
by the \fIprofile\fP and \fIcshrc\fP scripts.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 100, 13
A bug has been fixed in the \fIaedist -receive\fP and \fIaepatch
-receive\fP commands has been fixed.  There were cases where these
commands could access off the end of an array and SEGFAULT.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 199
A bug has been fixed in the \fIaede\fP(1) command when it received
pre-config-usage change sets.  It used to try to remove the last project
configuration file, which is a fatal error, and made it impossible to
receive the change set.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 72
A bug has been fixed which caused the \fIaetar\fP(1) command to hang
(actually, any thing which consulted LDAP or NIS) because the reserved
symbol "send" was being overloaded.  The reserved symbol "clone" was
also being overloaded.  Both have been fixed.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 70, 69
A bug has been fixed which caused the \fIaedist\fP(1)
command to reprt the wrong error when the input file did not exist.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 68
A bug has been fixed in the \fIaenbru\fP(1) command which made project
aliases disappear.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 59
A bug has been fixed in the \fIaede\fP command.  It would fail with new
build files already in the baseline.
