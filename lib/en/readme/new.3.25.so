Some optimizations have been done to the input parsing.  Depending on
your architecture, this will or won't be noticable.
.PP

.\" change 60
The locking has been changed so that \fIaeipass\fP(1) takes precedence
over new development builds, so that there is a guarantee that
\fIaeipass\fP(1) will succeed in finite time.  Current development builds
will run to completion, but new development builds will block until the
\fIaeipass\fP(1) gets the basline lock and subsequently completes.
.PP

The "file format error" bug in \fIaedist\fP(1) has been fixed.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 55
There is a new \fIproject activity\fP report, which is
useful to project leaders to see what has been happing in the project,
sorted by time and then by user name.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 55, 58
Aegis can now transparently cope with binary files, even if the history
tool cannot.  It does this by using a MIME encoding for binary files.
(This can be configured away, if your history tool correctly handles
binary files.)  See \fIaepconf\fP(5) and the \fIUser Guide\fP for more
information.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 51
There is a fix for the "file unrelated" error commonly seen on Solaris and
BSD when combined with an automounter, in come cases.  It relies on the
\fIbash\fP(1) behaviour which sets the \f[CW]$PWD\fP environment variable.
(GNU libc does this internally to the \fIgetcwd\fP(3) function,
not all libcs do.)
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 39
The \fIaer\fP(1) report generator now has access to the project
\fIconfig\fP file fields, through a new \f[CW]config\fP field in the
report generator's concept of the project state.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 38
There is a new \fIaer\fP(1) \f[CW]$comdir\fP substitution, which gives
access to the shared state directory, configured at build time.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 36
The \fIaebuffy\fP(1) now accepts a project name on the command line.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 33
There is a new \fIbuild_\%covers_\%all_\%architectures\fP field in the
project \fIconfig\fP file, so that you can tell Aegis that the build
tool builds all architectures wimultaneouasly.  See \fIaepconf\fP(5)
for more information.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 29
The \fItkaer\fP(1) command now has a comment editor, so that you can
edit your review fail comments from within the GUI.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 26
A bug has been fixed which was caused \fIaenbru\fP(1) to delete one
directory level too deep when the branch was removed.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 23
There is a new \f[CW]getuid()\fP function in the report generator.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 22, 27
This change fixed a bug in \fIaede\fP(1) where it would not allow
a branch, created with \fIaeimport\fP(1), with new files which had
subsequently been modified to end development, when those files had
never existed in the baseline.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 18
It is now possible for project administrators to nominate the developer
in the \fItkaenc\fP(1) dialog.  You are presented with a pick list.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 16
There is a new \fIaesub\fP(1) \f[CW]$history_directory\fP substitution.
This may be used in scripts which access the history tool's files directly.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 12
There is a new \fIchange_\%file_\%undo_\%command\fP field of the project
\fIconfig\fP file.  It is similar to the \fIchange_\%file_\%command\fP
field (it defaults to it if unset), but is executed by all of the ``undo''
file commands.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 11
The \fIaede\fP(1) command no longer cancels your build and test time
stamps.  This means that you don't need to re-build if you don't change
anything, after \fIaedeu\fP(1) or \fIaerfail\fP(1).
