.\" MANIFEST: document describing new 3.10 features
.\"
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The \fIaet\fP(1) command now accepts a \f(CW--force\fP option,
forcing tests to be run, even if Aegis doesn't think they need to.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The Aegis CGI interface has been enhanced so that you can download
changes from the generated web pages listing the changes,
using the \fIaedist\fP command.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The \fIaedist --send\fP command now accepts a \f(CW--no-ascii-armor\fP
option, which leaves off the MIME base 64 encoding.  Useful for binary
distributions and web servers.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
There is a new \fItrojan_horse_suspect\fP field in the project
\fIconfig\fP file.  This is used by \fIaedist --receive\fP to check for files
which could be abused to carry Trojan horse attacks.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The \fIaedist --receive\fP command now accepts a \f(CW--trojan\fP
option which treats the incoming change set as suspect, and
a \f(CW--no-trojan\fP option which treats the incoming change set as benign.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The \fIaedist --receive\fP command now quotes filenames (if necessary)
when executing commands, thus defending against filenames which contain
semicolons.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The \fIaenbru\fP(1) command has been implemented at last.
At last!
You no longer need to use the \fIaedbu\fP work-around.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The \fIaedbu\fP(1) command now gives an error if you attempt to apply
it to a branch.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The \fIaermpr\fP(1) command may now be applied to a project with active
branches, and will remove the branches as well (provided there are no
active changes on any of the branches).
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The \f(CWdos_\%filename_\%required\fP and
\f(CWwindows_\%filename_\%required\fP fields of the project \fIconfig\fP
file have been enhanced to reject the brain-dead Windows special filenames
such as \[lq]aux\[rq] \fIet al\fP.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The \f(CW${user}\fP and \f(CW${project}\fP substitutions have been
enhanced to provide additional information when given an additional argument.
Useful for file templates.  See \fIaesub\fP(5) for more information.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
Several portability enhacements, notably the Windows filename
incompatibility has been fixed, and also the Linux \fIstdlib.h\fP problem.
