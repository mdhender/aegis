.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The way the Apache configuration files are scanned for and read has
been changed,
to adapt to recent Apache changes.  The \fI./configure\fP script will
now find it more often.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The ``\fIaedist -receive\fP'' command has been enhanced to be more robust
about change sets without headers (some browsers \fIgenerously\fP strip
them all off.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
A bug has been fixed in the ``\fIaedist -receive\fP'' command which
sometimes caused decompression failures.  An unfortunate interaction with
the Windows NT support caused CRLF sequences in the compressed data to
be mangled in some cases.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The wrong include file was being used for \fPzlib\fP.
This has been fixed, so it should build more easily now.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The way MANPATH is handled on Linux has been improved in the \fIchsrc\fP
and \fIprofile\fP commands.  It will not over-ride \fI/etc/man.config\fP
now.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The \fIaegis.cgi\fP script has been made more robust in coping with
\fIaedist\fP errors.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The \fIsymlink_exception\fP field of the project \fIconfig\fP file now
accepts filename patterns, not simply literal filenames.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
There was a problem compiling with gcc 2.8, involving the <stdarg.h> header.
This has been fixed.
