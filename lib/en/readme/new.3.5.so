The \fIdiff3_command\fP field of the project \fIconfig\fP file has
been replaced by a \fImerge_command\fP field.  It works exactly the
same way, but Aegis moves the files around first, so that the output
replaces the change source file.  This results in fewer \[lq]lost\[rq] merges.
Those of you who have been hacking the \fIdiff3_command\fP to move the
files around will need to take the moves \fBout\fP when you rename the
\fIdiff3_command\fP field to be the new \fImerge_command\fP field.

The columnizing functions used by the report generator and the listings
has been enhanced to understand international character sets.  This allows
native character sets to be used in comments and descriptions, without
getting gibberish (C escapes) in the output.

There is a new \fIshell_safe_filenames\fP field in the project
\fIconfig\fP file.  This field controls whether filenames are required
to be free of shell special characters.  This field defaults to true if
not set, so if you are using any \[lq]interesting\[rq] filenames, you may need
to explicitly set this field to false.
(You still can't use spaces or international characters in filenames.)

.if t \(bu
There is a new ${quote} substitution for insulating shell special
characters in filenames in the commands in the project \fIconfig\fP file.

.if t \(bu
A number of bugs relating to environment variables have been corrected;
this will make the aereport and aefind commands behave more consistently,
with respect to the aegis command.
.PP

.if t \(bu
A bug has been fixed which caused the final newline of new test files
to be omitted.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
A bug which prevented the \[lq]aeb -minimum\[rq] option from working in any
non-trivial case has been fixed.
