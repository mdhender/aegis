.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The ``\fIaedist \-receive\fP'' command now accepts a \fB\-delta\fP option,
allowing a received change set to be applied to an historical version.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
There is now some information about managing super-projects and
sub-projects in the \fIBranching\fP chapter of the User Guide.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The \fIaenpr\fP(1) command now accepts a \fI\-keep\fP option, so that
you can re-attach projects moved after using the \fIaermpr \-keep\fP command.
See \fIaenpr\fP(1) for more information.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The \fIaenpr\fP(1) command now accepts \fI\-edit\fP and \fI\-file\fP options,
allowing you to specify project attributes when creating the project.
See \fIaenpr\fP(1) for more information.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
If the project \fIdevelopers_may_create_changes\fP attribute is true,
the \fIaencu\fP(1) command now allows developers to destroy changes
they created.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
There is a new \fIadd_path_suffix\fP substitution, for manipulating
search paths.  See \fIaesub\fP(5) for more information.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
There are 3 new substitutions: ${bindir}, ${datadir} and ${libdir}.
These are replaced by the \fI./configure\fP options of the same name
(or the values calculated, if none were given to \fI./configure\fP).
The old ${lib} substitution is deprecated in favour of the new ${datadir}
substitution.  See \fIaesub\fP(5) for more information.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
Some changes have been made which increases portability, particularly
the Linux libc5 \fIvs\fP libc6 differences.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
Some changes have been made which increases portability, particularly
for Windows NT.  This isn't to say Aegis works under Windows NT yet,
but it helps the porting efforts.  Don't forget to run the mkpasswd and
mkgroup utilities included in the Cygwin system.
