There is a new \fIaeimport\fP(1) command, which may be used to import
CVS archives into Aegis.
.PP

The cross branch merge has been improved so that it uses an earlier
version number than it was using, resulting in a more sensable merge.
.PP

A bug has been fixed in the \fI${quote}\fP substitution which incorrectly
quoted the exclamation mark (!).  Unfortunately, quoting isn't at all
simple, because you can't exclusively use single quotes \fIor\fP double
quotes \fIor\fP backslash.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 37
There is now a \fI${change description}\fP substitution, allowing you
access to the brief description of a change in a substitution.
(The suggested RCS history command have been changed to use it.)
.PP

A Dutch localization of the error messages has been contributed.

Project administrators can also use the \fIaeibu\fP(1) command.
Handy for abandoned integrations which inconvenience everyone else.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 25
There is a new project \fIconfig\fP file field, called
\f[CW]build_\%covers_\%all_\%architectures\fP, which allows you to tell
Aegis that your build process can cover all architectures simultaneously.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" changes 22 and 39
The \fI${quote}\fP substitution has been fixed to correctly quote more
characters.  It now prefers the single quote (but is is npt possible to
use this exclusively).
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 19
The web site now uses PDF files for documentation, rather than gzipped
PostScript.  This was for lots of reasons, including the fact theat many
folks couldn't work out how to print them,
and also IE decompressed them \[lq]for free\[rq] but left the .gz suffix.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 18
The report generator, \fIaereport\fP(1), can now access fields of the
\fI.aegisrc\fP file.  This is important for accessing the preferred
email address in various reports.
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 17
The \[lq]\fIaecp \-delta\fP\[rq] command now adds removed files to the change
as removed files instead of adding them as copied\[hy]but\[hy]empty files.
This should make reproducing projects more accurate, but you need to
use \fIaermu\fP(1) to get rid of them ,rather than \fIaecpu\fP(1).
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 16
The \fIaedist\fP program now adds a \[lq]Content\[hy]Disposition\[rq] header to
the files it generates.  This means MIME programs will unpack it into
a correctly named file more often.
.PP
Numerous build problems have been fixed,
both for Unix and for Cygwin (Windows).
There have benn some test script improvements, too.
.PP
Contributions have started to roll in using the \[lq]aedist\[rq] format.
This is
very encouraging.  The instructions for how to do this are contained in
the \[lq]Howto\[rq], in the \fIDeveloper\fP section.
