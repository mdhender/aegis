There is a new \[lq]\--No-Page-Headers\[rq] option which
may be used to suppress page and column headers in listings and reports.
.PP

.if t \(bu
.\" change 56
There is a new \[lq]aecp \-delta-from-change\[rq] option, allowing the
specification of a delta number by specifying the number of a
completed change.
.PP

The \[lq]aecp -ind -delta\[rq] command now omits files which did not exist at
the given delta.
.PP

There is a new \fIhistory_\%label_\%command\fP which may be used to
label your history files at each integration.  See \fIaepconf\fP(5)
for more information.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 53
The code which guesses which change you are working on, based on your
current directory, has been enhanced to cover far more cases.
It can recognize the integration directory, too.

.if t \(bu

There is a new \fIChange_Log\fP report, which generates reports in the style
of common Internet change logs.
.PP

The web interface is now able to show you file differences between deltas.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 47
A bug has been fixed in the \[lq]\fIaecp -delta\fP\[rq] command (for all
delta variants).  The problem occurred when you wanted to copy a
version of the file before the file has been modified by the branch
(but it wasonly a problem for files modified later in the branch, files
never modified by the branch were OK).  As a side-effect of the bug fix,
\[lq]\fIaecp -delta\fP\[rq] now goes significantly faster (\fIN\fP times faster,
where \fIN\fP is the number of files you are copying).
.PP

Build problems caused by new Bison releases have been fixed.

A number of oversights in handling the new \fIawaiting review\fP state
have been corrected.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 41
The \fI${expr}\fP substitution has been enhanced to include modulo,
logical not and the six relative operators.  All using the usual C syntax
and precedences.  See \fIaesub\fP(5) for more information.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 40
There is a new \fI${switch}\fP substitution, see \fIaesub\fP(5) for
more information.

A Russian localization of the error messages has been contributed.

A bug has been fixed in the \[lq]aecp -output\[rq] code, which sometimes
incorrectly created directories.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 35
A bug has been fixed in the symbolic link maintenance code.  It now
repairs links which point to a file which is too deep in the ancestor
tree, and has been subsequently replaced.  It now uses a single pass,
rather than two passes.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 34
The \fIchange_\%file_\%command\fP field of the project \fIconfig\fP
file is now available at a finer granularity.  There are 8 new commands
(the \fIcopy_\%file_\%command\fP, \fIcopy_\%file_\%undo_\%command\fP,
\fInew_\%file_\%command\fP, \fInew_\%file_\%undo_\%command\fP,
\fInew_\%test_\%command\fP, \fInew_\%test_\%undo_\%command\fP,
\fIremove_\%file_\%command\fP and \fIremove_\%file_\%undo_\%command\fP
fields) which may be individually configured.  They default to the
previous behaviour, for backwards compatibility.  See \fIaepconf\fP(5)
for more information.

A bug has been fixed in the \fIaepatch\fP(1) command, which prevented
it form constructing patches for changes on completed branches.
.PP

The \fIaeipass\fP(1) command now issues an error message if the build
changes a source file.  (Previously it erroneously reported that the
history tool had done the damage.)
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu

A bug has been fixed in \[lq]aecpu -unchanged\[rq] in the case where the change
had no files.  (It tried to uncopy a file called the empty thring.)
.PP

.if t \(bu
.\" change 11
The missing \fIaemvu\fP(1) man page has been added.
