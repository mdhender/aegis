Some users were unable to build the previous release, due to inconsistent
wide character support by the various UNIX vendors.  This has now
been fixed.
.PP

.if t \(bu
There are two new substitutions,
.I trim_directory
and
.IR trim_extension ,
which are useful for constructing file templates.  These can be
very useful in constructing skeletons of C++ classes.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
Some changes have been made to pathname handling to better cope with
automounters.  See \fIaegis\fP(1) for more information (see discussion
of the AEGIS_\%AUTOMOUNT_\%POINTS environment variable).  This assumes
that paths below the automounter's mount directory are echoes of paths
without it (\fIe.g.\fP \f[CW]/home\fP is the trigger, and
\f[CW]/tmp_mnt/home\fP is where the NFS mount is performed, with
\f[CW]/home\fP appearing to be a symlink).
