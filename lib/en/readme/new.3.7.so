Some users were unable to build the previous release, due to inconsistent
wide character support by the various UNIX vendors.  This has now
been fixed.

There are two new substitutions,
.I trim_directory
and
.IR trim_extension ,
which are useful for constructing file templates.  These can be
very useful in constructing skeletons of C++ classes.

Some changes have been made to pathname handling to better cope with
automounters.  See \fIaegis\fP(1) for more information (see discussion
of the AEGIS_\%AUTOMOUNT_\%POINTS environment variable).  This assumes
that paths below the automounter's mount directory are echoes of paths
without it (\fIe.g.\fP \f[CW]/home\fP is the trigger, and
\f[CW]/tmp_mnt/home\fP is where the NFS mount is performed, with
\f[CW]/home\fP appearing to be a symlink).
