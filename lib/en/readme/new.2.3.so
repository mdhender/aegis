The merging behaviour of the
.IR aed (1)
command has changed.
If any files require merging, it only merges.
In this way, merged files are not lost in the rest of the output.
Also,
there are now command line options and user preferences
so that you can select to only merge or only difference.
See
.IR aed (1)
and
.IR aeuconf (5)
for more nformation.
