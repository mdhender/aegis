.if n *
.if t \(bu
A bug in the merge command has been fixed.  It no longer deletes all of
your change source files if one of the merge commands fails.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
There is a new \fItkaegis\fP command, using Tk/Tcl to give Aegis a GUI.
Contributed by Graham Wheeler <gram@cdsec.com>.
Please report \fItkaegis\fP bugs and suggestions to Graham.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The integrate pass command has been enhanced to cope with RCS and SCCS
expanding keywords in source files (modifying the repository) on check-in.
This can be ignored, or a warning can be issued, or it can be a fatal
error (this is the default).  See \fIaeipass\fP(1) for more information.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The worked example in the User Guide has (finally!)
been updated to use the new branch numbering.
Numerous spelling errors have been corrected.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The developer section of the worked example chapter now also includes
discussion of some common questions raised by folks evaluating Aegis.
It covers insulating development directories from the baseline,
partial check-in and collaboration.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The \fIaesub\fP(5) man page now brings attention to the fact that the
${Copyright_\%Years} substitution contains spaces.  You often need to
quote it.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The man pages which mention filename limitations, now also note that where
underlying file-system has stricter filename length limitations than the
\fIfilename_\%maximum_\%length\fP field in the project \fIconfig\fP file,
the file-system wins.  Mention of this is now also present in
\fIaedb\fP(1), \fIetc\fP; Linux UMSDOS is highlighted as problematic.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
Aegis can now collect code metrics.
See \fIaeb\fP(1) and \fIaeipass\fP(1) for more information.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
There are three new report functions available: \fIquote_url\fP,
\fIquote_html\fP and \fIunquote_url\fP.  These are all for use when
creating Aegis reports for the CGI interface.
See \fIaer\fP(5) for more information.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
There are several new substitutions available.  These include
\f(CWsubst\fP, \f(CWtrim_extension\fP, \f(CWtrim_directory,\fP and
\f(CWtrim_filename\fP.  See \fIaesub\fP(5) for more information.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The integrate_q.sh script now works correctly for branches.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
Numerous configure, make and install problems have been fixed
for a variety of portability targets.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The RPM spec file has been corrected to use appropriate file attributes.
