A bug has been fixed in \[lq]ael cf\[rq].  It used to fail an
assertion when there were no files in the change.

A bug has been fixed which caused aeipass to segfault when
adjusting file modification time stamps in some
circumstances.
.PP

A bug has been fixed in the cross branch merging code.  It
would sometime erroneously complain about files no longer
being in the baseline.
.PP

.if t \(bu
.\" change 17
A bug has been fixed which caused \fIaedist\fP(1) and \fIaeannotate\fP(1)
to segfault.  It was caused by the roll forward history mechanism ignoring
some branches in some cases.
.PP

A  bugs has been fixed in the \fIaenrv -Descend_Project_Tree\fP
option, which was free()ing a project twice, sometimes causing segfaults.

The \fIaeget\fP CGI interface is now able to retrieve historical
versions of files.

The \fIaeget\fP CGI interface now has support for file metrics.

.if t \(bu
.\" change 30
The \fIaeget\fP CGI interface has been enhanced to provide more
information about project files and change files:
activity, conflicts, history.
.PP

.if t \(bu
.\" change 21
The \fIaeipass\fP(1) command now sets the
AEGIS_\%INTEGRATION_\%DIRECTORY environment variable before running the
\fIintegrate_\%pass_\%notify_\%command\fP, so that you can add a symlink
for compilers which insist on placing absolute paths into debugging
information in object files.

The \fIaeget\fP CGI interface has been enhanced to provide more
information about project files and change files -
activity, conflicts, history.

The \fIaeget\fP CGI interface now reports more project information.
.PP

.if t \(bu
.\" change 22
The \fIaeget\fP CGI interface now has download links in many of its menus,
allowing more and better downloads than the old \fIaegis.cgi\fP(1) script.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 26
The way \fIaenf\fP(1) and \fIaent\fP(1) work have been made more generous.
It is now possible to \fIaerm\fP(1) a file and then \fIaenf\fP(1) or
\fIaent\fP(1) the same file in the same change.  This is useful for
changing the type of a file.  Previously this has to be done as two
consecutive changes.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 29
The \fIaecp \-independent\fP command has been enhanced to allow you
to extract versions of built files (created with \fIaenf -build\fP and
maintained at \fIaeipass\fP(1) time).
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu

Documentation has been added to \fIaer\fP(5) for the try/catch mechanism.

There was a disagreement between the \fIaereport\fP(1),
\fIaeannotate\fP(1), \fIaedist\fP(1), \fIaefind\fP(1), \fIaeimport\fP(1),
\fIaels\fP(1), \fIaepatch\fP(1), \fIaerect\fP(1), \fIaetar\fP(1) and
\fIaexml\fP(1) man pages and the commands themselves about the existence
of the \fB\-version\fP option.  The commands now behave as documented.

There is a new \fIProject_\%Branch_\%Dates\fP report, which may be used
to see when branches of a project were begun and completed.
