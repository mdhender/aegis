It is now possible to remove users who's accounts have been removed (the
affects the \fIaera\fP(1), \fIaerd\fP(1), \fIaeri\fP(1) and \fIaerrv\fP(1)
commands).
.PP

.\" change 28
There is a new \fI--description-only\fP option to the \fIaeca\fP(1)
command.  This is useful for editing only the descrioption, and also
for use within scripts.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 27
The \fI--file\fP option has now been generalized to accept \[lq]-\[rq] to mean
the standard input.  This is useful in scripts.
.PP

There is a new \fIaebuffy\fP(1) command, which may be used to see
what changes a user has outstanding.  It needs X11 (Tk/Tcl) to work.
Named after the \fIxbuffy\fP(1) command.

The \fItkaer\fP(1) command now presents you with a \[lq]detail\[rq] button,
so that you may see the change details when pwerforming a review.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 21
The restriction that placed the function name at the start of the command
line (\fIe.g.\fP the \[lq]\-cp\[rq] of \fIaecp\fP) has been relaxed.
This may now
appear anywhere on the command line.
.PP

The Bourne / BASH shell aliases have been improved, so that they now
preserve quoting of special characters and white space.  This dates from
the earliest days of Aegis.  It's wonderful to have it fixed at last.
.PP

.if t \(bu
.\" change 19
There is a new \fIaemvu\fP(1) command, which may be used to undo the
effects of an \fIaemv\fP(1) command.
This should prove less confusing than the previous method.
.PP

.if t \(bu

A big has been fixed in the \fIaemv\fP(1) command.
It failed to accept the --base-relative option, even though it was
documented to do so.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 17
A bug has been fixed in the quote_tcl() report function.  Is fixes the
problem with getting the dollars sign into descriptions when using the
\fItkaenc\fP(1) command.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 15
The SCCS section of the \fIUser Guide\fP and example configurations have
been updated and confirmed to work correctly, however I've only tested
this with GNU CSSC.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 12
A bug in the file name handling has been fixed.  This was
most obvious around the \fIaecpu\fP(1) command when you had
\fIcreate_\%symlinks_\%before_\%build\fP turned on and you were using
an automounter, but it occured at other times as well.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 11
The \fIaeimport\fP(1) command now understands the SCCS format.
If the comments in GNU CSSC are accurate, this also means you can import
BitKeeper repositories, however I am unable to confirm this.
