.\" MANIFEST: document describing new 3.6 features
.\"
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The \fIaeifail\fP(1) and \fIaerfail\fP(1) commands now have a new --reason
option, to specify the failure reason on the command line, rather than
in a file.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
Some file operations are now faster.  Mostly, this applies to operations
which mention many files, and to projects with large numbers of files.
Smaller projects may not notice any improvement.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
There is a new \fB--delta-date\fP option to the \fIaecp\fP(1) command,
allowing deltas to be extracted by date.  This change also had the
side-effect of making extraction by delta number more accurate on
branches.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
There is a new \fB--base-relative\fP option to most of the file manipulation
commands, \fIaecp\fP(1), \fIaenf\fP(1), \fIetc\fP.  This option may be
used to specify that relative filenames are relative to the base of the
source tree, rather than the current directory.  There is also a related
user preference, see \fIaeuconf\fP(5) for more information.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
There is a new ``aeclean'' command.  It can be used to clean your
development directories of non-source files.
See \fIaeclean\fP(1) for more information.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The \fIaeb\fP(1) command now passes through arguments of the form
\fIname\fP\fB=\fP\fIvalue\fP, on the assumption that these are variable
assignments for th ebuild tool.  Previously, they were ``resolved'' as if
they were file names.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
A serious bug in the error and interrupt handling has been fixed.
This bug would sometimes case Aegis to hang, and eventually run out of stack,
when the user attempted to interrupt Aegis using ^C.
