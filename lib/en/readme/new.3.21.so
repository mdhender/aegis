\fBPlease Note:\fP Some code has been added to Aegis to assist in
diagnosing problems when restoring projects from backups.  If you see
a message \[lq]aegis: \fIproject\[hy]path\fP: has been tampered with
(fatal)\[rq]
this means there are problems with the project file ownerships.
The project owner needs to be >= AEGIS_UID (defaults to 100),
and the project group needs to be >= AEGIS_GID (defaults to 10).
Use chown \-R and/or chgrp \-R to fix these problems.
