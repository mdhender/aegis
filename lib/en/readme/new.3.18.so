.PP

You can now run a command to generate new file templates if you want,
rather than using a simple string substitution.
See \fIaenf\fP(1), \fIaent\fP(1) and \fIaepconf\fP(5) for more information.
The existing functionality is still there.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 28
There is a new ${SUBSTitute} substitution, which provides regular
expression substitutions.  This is useful in new file templates.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 22
A bug has been fixed which allowed \fIaede\fP of a branch when there
were some kinds of outstanding changes.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 21
The automatic change number guessing has been improved slightly, and will
cope with some more variation in the \fIdevelopment_directory_template\fP
field.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 20
There are two new commands, \fIaenpa\fP(1) and \fIaerpa\fP(1) for
creating and removing project aliases.  This means that you can give
project branches more meaningful names.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 26
There is a new \fIaesub\fP(1) command.  It substitutes its arguments and
prints them, rather like the \fIecho\fP(1) command.  This is useful when
you need access to the Aegis substitutions in a script.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The command line option ``\f(CW\-\-\fP'' is now understood.  It means
``the rest of the arguments on the command line are filenames or
strings''.  Because this makes the options on the command line more
"order sensitive" than usual, use with care.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 18
There is a new \fItkaenc\fP(1) command, allowing you to create new
change via a Tcl/Tk GUI.
.\" change 17
(And a problem with TCL special characters in
description text has been fixed.)
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 19
The \fIaenf\fP(1) command now does the right thing with directories named
on the command line.  In particular, you can now use ``aenf .'' to import
whole directory trees.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 16
There is a new \fIState-File-Name\fP list type, useful when writing
cookbooks or makefiles to keep a web page in sync with a change.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 12
There is a new ${capitalize} substitution, useful for putting in new
file templates.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 10
A bug has been fixed which caused \fIaeclean\fP to delete the development
directory of changes with no files.
