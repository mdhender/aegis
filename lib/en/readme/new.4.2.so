There is now an interconnection between the \fIaeib\fP(1) and the
\fIaeb\fP(1) command.  When you specify a minimum integrate begin,
you also get a minimum integrate build.

the file name accept pattern.

The executability or otherwise of each source file is now remembered.
If any of the execute bits are set at \fIaede\fP(1) time, the file
is remembed as executable.  When an executable file is copied into an
integration directory or development directory, all of the execute bits
(minus the project umask) are set.

A bug has been fixed in the \[lq]\fIaecp -ind\fP\[rq] command, where it would
give a \[lq]there is no development directory\[rq] error when you tried to
extract a file version from history of a completed branch.

Interrupts are now ignored during database writes.
This should alleviate some of the problems induced by Ctrl-C.

The \fIaedist\fP(1) command has been enhanved to include a patch fragment
for modified files, as well as the whole source files.  On receipt, if
the patch applies cleanly the whole source is ignored.  If the file does
not exist at the receiving end, or the patch does not apply cleanly,
the whole source file is included.  The incrimental cost is very low,
because all of the patch pieces appear in the source file, and thus
compress exceptionally well.  The net result is to greatly reduce merge
costs on recipt of \f[CW].ae\fP files.  However, this change to
\fIaedist\fP(1) is only backwards compatiple.  Previous versions of
\fIaedist\fP(1) will give a fatal error if they see a \f[CW].ae\fP file
generated by this version of \fIaedist\fP(1).

It is now possible to specify a directory to contain project \fIconfig\fP
file fragments.  These fragments are then read in as if catenated as
a single project \fIconfig\fP file.  See \fIaepfonf\fP(5) for more
information.
