\fBPlease Note:\fP Users are advised to check the history command
settings in their project configuration files.  With the advent of
file UUIDs, the history mechanism now decouples source file names from
history file names.  In particular, the assumption that the history file
basename is the same as the source file basename is no longer true.
Correct settings may be found in the \fIlib/config.example/\fP directory
of the source distribution.

There is a new \fIdevelopment_\%directory_\%style\fP field of the
project configuration file.  This allows CVS-style and Arch-style
work areas, in addition to the BCS-style and viewpath work areas
already supported.
These new work area styles permit many existing projects to use Aegis with no
change to their build systems.
The \f[CW]libsndfile\fP and \f[CW]OpenLDAP\fP projects, for example,
have been imported and built without modification.
See \fIaepconf\fP(5) and the \fIDependency Maintenance Tool\fP chapter
of the User Guide for more information.

There is a new \fIaediff\fP(1) command, which may be used to obtain a
\fIdiff\fP(1) listing of a file for different deltas.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 157
There is a new \fIaepromptcmd\fP(1) command, used with bash's
PROMPT_COMMAND environment variable.
It can be used to obtain a colored prompt, simulating the process
described in Kent Beck's book \fITest Driven Development\fP.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 163, 113, 60
There is a new \fIsigned_off_by\fP field of the project configuration
file.  Set it to true if you want "\f[CW]Signed-off-by\fP" lines appended
to change set descriptions as the changes pass through the Aegis
process.
The \fIaede\fP(1) and \fIaerpass\fP(1) commands now understand two new
\fB\-signed-off-by\fP and \fB\-no-signed-off-by\fP options, to override the
project setting.
The \fIaedist -send\fP and \fIaepatch -send\fP commands also
understand the new \fB\-signed-off-by\fP option, to add the
"\f[CW]Signed-off-by\fP" line to the outgoing change set description.

The \fIaet\fP(1) command has been enhanced to allow integrators to run
specific tests.
.PP

The \fIaesub\fP(1) command can now read the text to be substituted from
a file or standard input.
.PP

It is now possible to use the project-specific attributes to specify
environment variables to be set for commands executed by Aegis.
This can be used to set a predictable PATH, for example.

It is now possible to customize the \fIaeget\fP(1) web interface using
project specific attributes.
.PP

.if t \(bu
.\" Change 101, 90, 85
The \fIael\fP(1) command and the \fIaeget\fP(1) web interface now have
file inventory pages, for the project file inventory and the change file
inventory.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 87, 86, 47
There is a new "change set inventory" listing available via the
\fIael\fP(1) command and the \fIaeget\fP(1) web interface, which lists
changes and their corresponding UUIDs, and links to an aedist download
for each change. The idea is that the \fIaeget\fP(1) pages may be used
to automate downloading change set your repository does not yet have.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 76
There are two new history commands in the project configuration
file, the history_transaction_begin and history_transaction_end
fields.  It is not an error if these fields are absent.  If you
need a transaction key, use the $version substitution.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 77, 32
The \fIaedist\fP(1) command now runs all tests required for the change
set, and honors test exemptions.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 78
The \fIaedist\fP(1) command now sleeps for a second to ensure that the
last-time-modified of derived files will be strictly later than source
files, and that the \fIaeb\fP(1) timestamp will also be strictly later
then the last-time-modified for the source files.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 75
The tkdiff(1) man page has been updated to say how to use
mgdiff(1) instead of tkdiff(1).
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 69
All commands which accept the \fB\-change\fP option may now be given a
change set UUID.  You can discover a change's UUID using the \fIael
cd\fP (list change details) or \fIael inventory\fP listings.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 108
The \fIaed\fP(1) command now restores source file from backups (,B)
when a merge fails.  Previously this was not the case and
subsquent aed invocations failed because the source file was
missing.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 58
The \fIaetar -send\fP command now has an \fB\-add-path-prefix\fP
option, so that you can add a path prefix to all of the
files in a tarball.
The \fIaeget\fP(1) CGI interface now adds a path prefix to generated
tarballs by default.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 57
Whenever you edit file attributes, there is a \f[CW]Content-Type\fP
attribute added automagically if none was there already.
The idea is that this could be used by scripts to differentiate file types.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 32
The \fIaepatch\fP(1) command now uses \fIdiff -u\fP by default.
