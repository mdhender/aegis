The \fIaeclone\fP(1) command now runs the \fIchange_file_command\fP
and \fIproject_file_command\fP from the project \fIconfig\fP file.
This is in order to be more consistent withthe \fIaecp\fP(1) command.

The "time safe" property described by Damon Poole mostly applies to Aegis'
operation.  One last area related to future times and the --delta options.
There is now a warning in the instance where non-time-safe behavior
may occur.

The \fIhistory_\%put_\%command\fP and \fIhistory_\%create_\%command\fP

There is a new \fIawaiting review\fP state, and new \fIaerb\fP(1) and
\fIaerbu\fP(1) commands to go with it.  It is now possible to configure
your project to have changes enter the \fIawaiting review\fP state after
\fIaede\fP(1), rather than the \fIbeing reviewed\fP state.  It is also
possible to skip the review  states altogether and immediatelt enter
the \fIawaiting integration\fP state.

The \fIaenbr\fP(1) command now populates the new branch's baseline with
symlinks if the project \fIconfig\fP file is set so that they would
remain after an integration build.  This is more consistent with the
\fIaedb\fP(1) behaviour in the same situation.
