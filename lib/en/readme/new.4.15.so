.\" MANIFEST: document describing new 4.15 features
.\"

.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 62
There is a new \fIaecp \-keep\fP option, causing \fIaecp\fP(1) \fBnot\fP
to overwrite file contents in the development directory.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 60, 59
The \fIaedist \-receive\fP option now understands changing the type of a file.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 58, 38, 21
It is now possible to specify a URL to the \fB\-file\fP option on the
command line of \fIaedist\fP(1), \fIaepatch\fP(1) and \fIaetar\fP(1).
The data will be downloaded and applied.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 56, 36, 32, 31
More work has been done towards making the code compilable by a C++ compiler.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 57
The project list (see \fIael\fP(1), \fIaeget\fP(1), etc) is now sorted
in a slightly more natural way, as are the version statistics at the
end of an \fIaeannotate\fP(1) listing.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 55
A bug has been fixed in \fIaede\fP91) for branches, where Aegis would
complain about build source files (created by the \fIaenf \-build\fP
command) being out-of-date.  This, of course, was difficult or impossible
to fix, and unnecessary because the next build would fix them.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 53
A bug has been fixed in the \fIaecp \-independent\fP command,
where it did not preserve the execute bit, nor honour the user's umask.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 51
The missing \fIaemt\fP and \fIaemtu\fP alias ve been added to the profile.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 50
More detail has been added to \fIaepconf\fP(5) detailing how to create
the project config file for the first time.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 35
A bug has been fixed in \fIaedist\fP(1) and \fIaepatch\fP(1) which would
cause an assertion failure (or segfault) when you tried to \fIaedist
\-send \-delta \-es\fP files which did not exist at that delta.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 33
A bug has been fixed in \fIaedist\fP(1) and \fIaepatch\fP(1) which caused
an assert failure (or segfault) when you tried to send a file which had
been created and removed in a branch, and after the branch was integrated
only a remove record exists in the parent branch.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 22
The problem with test 134 failing has been fixed.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 27
A bug has been fixed in \fIaeipass\fP91) which prevented changing a
file's usage from being as straight-forward as it should have been.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 29
The source RPM (and the \fIspec\fP file) now has Build Prequisites specified.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 28
The \fB\-Change\fP option now accepts more than just a change number.
It now accepts many forms similar to those used by the \fI${version}\fP
substitution, allowing its output to be used directly as command line
input; forms such as \f[CW]-c 1.2.C34\fP and \f[CW]--c=5.6.D78\fP
are now understood to imply a \fB\-branch\fP option as well as either
\fB\-change\fP or \fB\-change-from-delta\fP, respectively.  In addition,
you may prepend a project name, to imply the \fB\-project\fP option as
well; form such as \f[CW]-c aegis.4.15.C28\fP are understood.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 23
The \fIaemeasure\fP(1) program now also generates Halstead metrics.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 17
A bug has been fixed in the symbolic link handling code.  In some cases it
would report "multiple user permissions (bug)" and not complete correctly.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change NNN
A bug has been fixed in the test of \fIaedist\fP(1) for moved files.
There was nothing wrong with \fIaedist\fP(1), the test itself was broken.
