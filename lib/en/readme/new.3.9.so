As of this release you must have \fBzlib\fP installed before you can
build Aegis.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
There is a new \fIreuse_\%change_\%numbers\fP project attribute,
letting you control whether \fIaenc\fP fills in holes in the change
number sequence.  Defaults to true if not set.  See \fIaepattr\fP(5)
for more information.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
There is a new \fIintegrate_\%begin_\%exceptions\fP field in the project
\fIconfig\fP file.  This permits the user to specify file to be omitted
when the integration directory copy/link is performed.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The \fIaet\fP(1) command has been changed so that it does not exit with
an error if you have a test exemption but no tests.  This is no longer
an error.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
There is a new \fIaedist\fP(1) command, which may be used to send and
receive Aegis change sets via e-mail and the web.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The \fIaeclone\fP(1), \fIaenbr\fP(1), \fIaenc\fP(1) commands now accept
a \f(CB\-output\fP option, a file to contain the automatically generated
change number.  This greatly assists in writing scripts.  See the man
pages for more information.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
The \fIaent\fP(1) command now accepts a \f(CB\-output\fP option, a file
to contain the automatically generated file name.  See the man pages
for more information.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
There is a new \fIcompres_\%database\fP field in the project attributes,
allowing the Aegis database to be stored in a compressed form (using
the GNU Zip algorthm).  Unless you have an exceptionally large project,
coupled with fast CPUs and high network latency, there is probably very
little benefit in using this feature.  (The database is usually less
than 5% of the size of the repository.)  On slow networks, however,
this can sometimes improve the preformance of file-related commands.
