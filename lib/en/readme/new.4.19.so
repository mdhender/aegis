\fBPlease Note:\fP Users are advised to check the history command
settings in their project configuration files.  With the advent of
file UUIDs, the history mechanism now decouples source file names from
history file names.  In particular, the assumption that the history file
basename is the same as the source file basename is no longer true.
Correct settings may be found in the \fIlib/config.example/\fP directory
of the source distribution.

The defaulting rules for the change number (if none was specified
on the command line) have been altered. the current directory now
takes precedence over the "only one" rule.  This seems to meet user
expectations better.

.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 215
A bug has been fixed in the \fIaedist \-send \-entire\[hy]source\fP command
where it would hang for some cases.  (Actually, it would dump core after
using up all available swap space on an infinite recursion).
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 174
A bug has been fixed in the \fIaedist\fP command (and other places)
where the open of the project configuration file could fail, due to not
properly reconstructing in historical circumstances.
.PP

The \fIaeb\fP command now complains \fImuch\fP less about "directory not
empty" when using the link farm.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu

A bug has been fixed in the \fIaetar \-send \-entire\[hy]source\fP command
where some files were missing when asking for a complete set of
historical sources.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu

A bug has been fixed in the \fIaedist \-send \-entire\[hy]source\fP where
some files were zero length when asking for a complete set of historical
sources.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 14
A bug in \fIaedist\fP(1) has been fixed, it was forcing regression
test on the receiving side even if the change set does not require it
and \fIdefault_test_exemption\fP was set to true.  It was annoying
especially if the test suite take a long time to run completely.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 105, 101
Some bugs have been fixed in \fIaediff\fP(1) which caused it to
mis\[hy]parse the command line in some cases, and it was also barfing on the
expected exit status 1 when an actual difference was found.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 79
A bug has been fixed in the \fIaecpu\fP(1), \fIaemtu\fP(1),
\fIaemvu\fP(1), \fIaenfu\fP(1), \fIaentu\fP(1) and \fIaermu\fP(1)

the \fIdevelopment_\%directory_\%style\fP settings.

A bug has been fixed in the \fIChange_Files\fP listing;
it was not showing the locked\[hy]by information.

where it would segfault in some cases.
.PP

A bug has been fixed in reading plain \fIdiff\fP(1) format patches.
This was particularly obvious because \fIaeannotate\fP(1) uses this form
of diff by default.
.PP

A bug has been fixed in \fIaeget\fP(1) where it was showing removed
source files as available for download.

output if the SCRIPT_NAME environment was not set.
.PP

modifiers.  This was particularly noticable in the download pages.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 81
A bug has been fixed in the \fIaeimport\fP(1) command.  It was using the
old work area style configuration file parameters, instead of the new
\fIdevelopment_\%directory_\%style\fP settings.

A memory leak has been fixed in the symbol table code.
.PP
.if n *

The \fIaeintegratq\fP(1) command has a new \-loop\fP options, which
causes it to keep processing changes that become available while it is
running.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 228
The \fIaet\fP(1) command has a new \-sugest\[hy]limit option which runs as
many regression tests as possible (from most relevant to least relevant)
but stops after the given number of minutes.  This is a way for running
the most relevant tests in a limited time.  For example, this option
could be used if a project has so many integrations in a day that it can
only afford 20 minutes of integration testing for each one.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 183
The \fIaed\fP(1) man page has been updated to better describe the

.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 176
The \fIaetar \-receive\fP command now avoids copying build files from the
baseline because this operation is forbidden and the error stops the
processing.

There is a new \fI${Change_Attribute}\fP substitution, which is
replaced by the values of the change attributes named.

.if t \(bu
.\" Change 155
The history recapitulation code (project_file_roll_forward) now indexes
by UUID rather than by file name (with backwards compatibility for
UUID\[hy]less repositories).  The user visable result is that file history
reports and listings now accurately track renames.

.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 503, 216, 182

downloaded.

The \fIaefa\fP(1) command, with the \-edit option, now shows you the
content type, rather than adding it silently.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 276
There is a new \fIaediff \-command\fP option, allowing you to specify
the command you want to use to display the difference.  For example,
you could use \fItkdiff\fP(1) or \fImgdiff\fP(1) to display the change
graphically.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" Change 108
The \fIaediff\fP(1) command now adds labels when it is producing a
context or unified diff output.

.if t \(bu
.\" Change 73, 71, 69, 68, 55, 22

There is a new ${Change_Reviewer_List} substitution, which is
