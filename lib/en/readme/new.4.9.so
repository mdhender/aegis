There is a new \fIaemt\fP(1) command, used to make branch files
"transparent".  This is like an \fIaecpu\fP(1) command for branches, but
done through the agency of a change set.
.PP
\fBNote:\fP The behaviour of the view path in the presence of transparent
files is complete, however full support for \fIaecp \-delta\fP and reports
is not.  Support will be present in the next release.  File transparency
information stored by this release will be able to be used by \fIaecp
\-delta\fP and reports in the next release.

The \fIaedist\fP(1) program now includes a change number, which will be
used on receipt if possible.  Note that this produces .ae files which
are not backwards compatible; the -nopatch option will suppress inclusion
of the change number in the archive.
