The \fIaefind\fP(1) command now has \-resolve as the default.  To get
the previous behaviour, use the \-NoResolve\fP option.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 50
In the \fIaeca -e\fP and \fIaepa -e\fP commands, it is now possible to
quote strings with at-signs (@) instead of double quotes.  This type of
string allows newlines within the string.  See \fIaegis\fP(5) for more
information.

.if t \(bu
.\" change 39
For the benefit of Aegis developers, there is now HTML documentation
genaretd by Doxygen (if you have Doxygen installed).  When developing
an Aegis change, in your development directory, point your browser at
\f[CW]doxygen-html/\%index.html\fP.  The \f[CW]common/\%str.h\fP file
is an example of the style desired, should you wish to contribute to
the effort to get all of the header files suitably annotated.
.\" Change 11
Also, the removal of the K&R C support has started, see the files in
\f[CW]common/*.[ch]\fP for examples.
.\" Change 55
Also <varargs.h> is not longer used anywhere.

.if t \(bu
.\" change 37
The \fIaedist\fP(1) command has two new options, \-patch and \-nopatch,
which may be used to control how and when \fIaedist\fP uses patches.

.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 35
The \fIaeca\fP(1) command now accepts a \-fix-architecture option.

.if t \(bu
.\" change 33
The \fIaedist -receive\fP command now runs the \fIaeca -fixarch\fP command
when a change set arrives which modified the project \fIconfig\fP file.
This should fix many of the "architecture not in project configuration file"
problems when seeding new projects.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 32
Some deficiencies on the ``How to Become a Developer'' instructions have
been addressed.
.\" change 30

.if t \(bu
.\" change 26, 28, 29

The command completion for the \fIaet\fP(1) command now works better;
it now completes project test names as well as change test names.
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 15
The \fIaepatch\fP(1) and \fIaedist\fP(1) commands now cope with a wider
range of input vagueries, including some weird things done by MTAs and
more content transfer encoding synonyms.
