The \fIaepatch\fP(1) command now understands the quoted-printable content
transfer encoding.

There was a problem with the way the install directory for
\fIaegis.cgi\fP was being determined.  The \fIaegis.cgi\fP script is now
installed into \f[CW]$bindir\fP by default.  There is a \fIaegis.cgi.i\fP
helper script to find your web server's \fIcgi-bin\fP directory and copy
\fIaegis.cgi\fP there, but this is not done automatically.
See \fIaegis.cgi\fP(1) for more information.

A big has been fixed in the uuencode output,
which could occasionally miss the "begin" line.

.if t \(bu

A bug has been fiexed in the context diff parsing, where it would get the
last hunk wrong if it was a hunk which deleted lines, due to incorrect
end-of-file handling.  This affected both \fIaepatch -receive\fP and
\fIaedist -receive\fP, because \fIaedist\fP(1) now includes patches for
better merge behaviour.
