.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 28
The project \fIconfig\fP file now contains two new fields,
\fIcreate_\%symlinks_\%before_\%integration_\%build\fP and
\fIremove_\%symlinks_\%after_\%integration_\%build\fP, which may be used
to better control the behavior of the symlink farm at integration time.
(Default behavior is backwards compatible.)
.PP
.if n *
.if t \(bu
.\" change 27
A new utility called \fItkaer\fP has been contributed.
It is for reviewing, and shows you lists of files.

You're going to like this one, folks!

.if t \(bu

A nasty Catch\[hy]22 in the \fIaedist\fP(1) command has been fixed, involving

files don't yet exist in the \-receive development directory.
