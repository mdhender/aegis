# MANIFEST: English localization
#
# Just A Few Notes...
#
#	When translating these error messages, all of the substitutions
#	described in aesub(5) are also available.  Substitution variable
#	names and function names may be abbreviated, in the same way
#	that command line options are abbreviated, but abbreviation
#	should probably be avoided.
#
#	While Aegis was written by an English speaker, this English
#	localization file is necessary, to translate the ``terse
#	programmer'' style error messages into something more user
#	friendly.
#
#	Messages which include state names need to leave the state names
#	untranslated, because they will probably never be translated.
#
#	Messages which include command line options need to leave them
#	untranslated, because they are not yet internationalized, though
#	they will be one day.
#
#	The list names (known to ael) have not been internationalized (yet).
#
#	Substitution names will Never be internationalized.
#	Otherwise the substitutions will stop working, Catch-22.
