.nh 1 "How Aegis Works"
.LP
Before you will be able to exploit aegis fully,
you will need to know what aegis does and why.
.LP
The aegis program provides a change control mechanism and a repository,
a subset of the functionality
which CASE vendors call Software Configuration Management (SCM).
In order to fit into a software engineering environment,
or any place software  is written,
aegis needs a clearly defined place is the scheme of things.
.LP
This chapter describes the model of the software development process
embodied in the aegis program,
some of the deliberate design decisions made for aegis,
some of the things aegis will and wont do for you,
and the situations where aegis is most and least useful.
