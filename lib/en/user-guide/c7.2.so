.\" MANIFEST: User Guide, How Aegis Works, Philosophy
.\"
.bp
.nh 2 "Philosophy"
.LP
The philosophy is simple,
and that makes some of the implementation complex.
.LP
\(bu
When a change is in the
.I "being developed"
state,
the aegis program is a developer's tool.
Its purpose is to make it as easy for a developer
to develop changes as possible.
.LP
\(bu
When a change leaves (or attempts to leave) the
.I "being developed"
state,
the aegis program is protecting the  project baseline,
and does not exist to make the developer happy.
.LP
\(bu
The aegis program attempts to adhere to the
.UX
minimalist philosophy.
Least unnecessary output,
least command line length,
least dependence on \fIspecific\fP 3rd party tools.
.LP
\(bu
No overlap in functionality of cooperating tools.
(I.e. no internal build mechanism, no internal history mechanism, etc.)
.nh 3 "Development"
.LP
During the development of a change,
the aegis program exists to help the developer.
It helps him navigate around his change and the project,
it copies file for him,
and keeps track of the versions.
It can even tell him what changes he has made.
.nh 3 "Post Development"
.LP
When a change has left the "being developed" state,
or when it is attempting to leave that state,
the aegis program ceases to attempt to help the developer
and proceeds to defend the project baseline.
The model used by aegis states that "the baseline always works",
and aegis attempts to guarantee this.
.nh 3 "Minimalism"
.LP
The idea of minimalism is to help the user out.
It is the intention that the aegis program can work out
unstated command line options for itself,
in cases where it is "safe" to do so.
This means a number of defaulting mechanisms,
all designed to help the user.
.nh 3 "Overlap"
.LP
It was very tempting while writing the aegis program
to have it grow and cover
source control and dependency maintenance roles.
Unfortunately,
this would have meant that the user would have been trapped
with whatever the aegis program provided,
and the aegis program is already plenty big.
To add this functionality would have diverted effort,
resulting in an inferior result.
It would also have violated the underlying
.UX
philosophy.
.nh 3 "Design Goals"
.LP
A number of specific ideas molded the shape of the aegis program.
These include:
.LP
The
.UX
philosophy of writing small tools for specific tasks with little
or no overlap.
Tools should be written with the expectation of use in
pipes or scripts,
or other combinations.
.LP
\(bu Stay out of the way.
If it is possible to let a project do whatever it
likes,
write the code to let it.
It is not possible to anticipate even
a fraction of the applications of a software tool.
.LP
\(bu People.
The staff using aegis should be in charge of the development
process.
They should not feel that some machine is giving them orders.
.LP
\(bu Users aren't psychic.
Feedback must be clear,
accurate and appropriate.
