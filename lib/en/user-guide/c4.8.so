.nh 2 "No Build Required"
.LP
For some projects, particularly web sites and those written exclusively
in interpreted languages, it may not be necessary to ever actually build
your project.
.LP
For this kind of project you add the following line
to the project configuration file:
.E(
build_command = "exit 0";
.E)
For a project configured in this way,
the \fIaede\fP(1) and \fIaeipass\fP(1) commands
will not check that a build has been performed.
.nh 3 "Why This May Not Be Such A Good Idea"
.LP
It isn't always desirable to configure a project this way,
even when it may initialy appear to be a good idea.
.IP "Web sites:"
You can use the build stage to check the HTML files against the relevant
standards and DTDs.  You can also check that all of you (internal) links
are valid, and don't point to non-existant pages or anchors.  Sometimes,
if you have the space, you can resolve server side includes, to make it
faster for Apache, by serving static pages.
.IP "Interpreted Languages:"
A whole lot of simple errors, such as syntax errors, can be caught by a
static check of the source files.
For example, the \f[CW]perl -c\fP option can syntax check your Perl files
without executing them.
See also the GNU \f[CW]awk \-lint\fP option,
the Python built-in \f[CW]compile()\fP function,
and the \f[CW]php -l\fP (lower case L) option.
You can also check that all include files referenced actually exist.
.IP "Documentation:"
Many systems allow documentation to be extracted from the source files,
and turned into HTML or PDF files (\fIe.g.\fP Doxygen).
This is a sensable thing to do at build time.
