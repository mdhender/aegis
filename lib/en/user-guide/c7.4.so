.nh 2 "Further Work"
.LP
The aegis program is far from finished.
A number of features are known to be lacking.
.PP
At the date of this writing,
aegis is being actively supported and improved.
.nh 3 "Hierarchy of Projects"
.LP
It would be nice if there was some way to use 
one projects as a sort of "super change" to a "super project",
so that large teams (say 1000 people)
could work as lots of small teams (say 100 people).
As a small team gets their chunk ready,
using the facilities provided to-date by aegis,
the small team's baseline is treated as a change to be made to the
large team baseline.
.LP
This idea can be extended quite naturally to any depth of layering.
.LP
The desired semantics,
let alone the implementation details,
can not begin without  more experience to show (and fix) the warts
on the existing functionality.
.LP
After reading
.I "Transaction Oriented Configuration Management: A Case Study"
Peter Fieler, Grace Downey, CMU/SEI-90-TR-23,
this is not a new idea.
It also provides some ideas for how to do branching sensably.
.nh 3 "Code Coverage Tool"
.LP
It would be very helpful if a code coverage tool could be used
to analyze tests included with changes to ensure that the tests
actually exercised the lines of code changed in the change.
.LP
Another use of the code coverage tool would be to select regression tests
based on the object files recompiled by a change,
and those regression tests which exercise those files.
.LP
While there is freeware C code coverage tool available,
based on GNU C,
the interfacing and semantics still need more thought.
.nh 3 "Branching"
.LP
The aegis program does not provide support for branching
in the history files.
The semantics of the baseline,
the source files and their closure,
would appear to imply that a baseline is required for every leaf
in the history tree.
.LP
Branching is provided in this way with the
.I "new release"
functionality.
An entire new project is derived from an existing project,
including another baseline.
The history,
however,
is severed from the original project,
precluding automatic merging by aegis at a later date.
It also precludes having a single change to be applied
to more than one branch.
.LP
Should better semantics become available,
or a better algorithmic approach,
this is certainly one area of aegis which could be improved.
.nh 3 "Virtual File System"
.LP
There is almost sufficient information in the aegis data base to create a virtual file system,
overlaying the development directory atop the baseline\**.
.FS
Reminiscent of Sun's TFS,
but not the same.
.FE
This could be implemented similarly to automounters,
intercepting file system operations by pretending to be an NFS server.
Many commercial CASE products provide such a facility.
.LP
Such a virtual file system has a number of advantages:
you don't need such a capable DMT, for starters;
it only needs the dynamic include dependencies,
and does not need a search path\**.
.FS
Discussed in the
.I "Dependency Maintenance Tool"
chapter.
.FE
Second,
many horrible and dumb compilers,
notably FORTRAN and "fourth" GLs,
don't have adequate include semantics;
overlaying the two directories make this much easier to deal with\**.
.FS
There are other ways,
discussed in the
.I "Tips and Traps"
chapter.
.FE
Many graphical tools,
such as bubble chart drawers, etc,
when they do actually have include files,
have no command line specifiable search path.
.LP
The disadvantage is that this adds significant complexity
to an already large program.
Also,
implementation is limited to NFS capable systems,
or would have to be rewritten for a variety of other systems.
The semantics of interactions between the daemon and other aegis
commands, while clearly specifiable, are challenging to implement.
Performance could also be a significant factor.
.LP
The question is "is it really necessary?"
If the job can be done without it,
does the effort of writing such a beast result
in significant productivity gains?
.LP
The addition of the
.I create_symlinks_before_build
field to the project
.I config
file has greatly reduced the need for this functionality.
However, it does not provide
copy-on-write semantics,
nor automatic
.I aecp
functionality;
which a virtual file system could do.
