.nh 2 "Year 2000 Status"
.LP
Aegis does not suffer from Year 2000 problems.
.LP
\(bu
Aegis stores dates internally in Unix style (\fIi.e.\fP seconds
offset), so internal storage of times and dates does not suffer from
any Y2K problems.
.LP
\(bu
Aegis always uses the ANSI C standard \f(CWstrftime\fP function to display
times and dates.  (This assumes that your vendor has supplied a compliant
\f(CWstrftime\fP.)  This means that displaying dates does not assume
fixed field widths, nor will it display the year 2000 as \[lq]100\[rq].
.LP
\(bu
There is no user-input of years at any time, so there is no issue
surrounding \[lq]guessing\[rq] the century.
