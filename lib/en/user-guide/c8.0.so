.nh 1 "The Difference Tools"
.LP
This chapter describes the difference commands in the
project configuration file.
Usually these commands are used by the 
.I "aegis -DIFFerence"
command when differencing files,
but they may be used to accomplish some other things.
.LP
The default setting is for Aegis to reject filenames which contain shell
special characters.  This ensures that filenames may be substituted
into the commands without worrying about whether this is safe.  If you
set the \fIshell_safe_filenames\fP field of the project \fIconfig\fP
file to \f(CWfalse\fP, you will need to surround filenames with the
\f[CW]${quote\fP \fIfilename\fP\f[CW]}\fP substitution.  This will only
quote filenames which actually need to be quoted, so users usually will
not notice.  This command applies to all of the various filenames in
the sections which follow.
.so c8.1.so
.so c8.2.so
