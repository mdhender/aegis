.nh 2 "What does aegis do?"
.LP
Just what is software configuration management?
This question is sufficiently broad as to require a book in answer.
In essence, the aegis program is a project change supervisor.
It provides a
framework within which a team of developers may work on many changes to a
program independently,
and the aegis program coordinates integrating these
changes back into the master source of the program,
with as little disruption as possible.
Resolution of contention for source files,
a major headache for any project with more than one developer,
is one of the aegis program's major functions.
.LP
It should be noted that the aegis program is a developer's tool,
in the same sense as make or RCS are developer's tools.
It is not a manager's tool - it does not provide progress tracking
or help with work allocation.
