.nh 2 "Automatic Operation"
.LP
This section describes how to use \fIaedist\fP to automatically send
change sets via e-mail.
.nh 3 "Sending"
.LP
Change sets can be sent automatically when a change passes integration.
You do this by setting the \fIintegrate_\%pass_\%notify_\%command\fP
field of the project attributes.
.LP
In this example, the ``example'' project sends all integrations to all
the addresses on the \f(CWexample-developers\fP mailing list.  (The
mailing list is maintained outside of Aegis, \fIe.g.\fP by Majordomo.)
The relevant attribute (editted by using the \fIaepa\fP(1) command)
looks like this:
.E(
integrate_pass_notify_command =
  "aedist -p $project -c $change | \e
  mail example-users";
.E)
.LP
Please note that project attributes are inherited by branches when they
are created.  If you don't want all branches to broadcast all changes,
you need to remember to clear this project attribute \fIfrom the branch\fP
once the branch has been created.  Alternatively, use the \f(CW$version\fP
substitution to decide who to send the change to.
.nh 3 "Receiving"
.LP
\fIwrite this section\fP
.LP
You need to set up an e-mail alias, with a wrapper around it - you
probably \dIdon't\fP want "daemon" as a registered developer.
.LP
While \fIaedist\fP(1) makes every attempt to spot potential trojan attacks,
you really, \fIreally\fP want PGP validation (or similar industrial
strength digital signatures) before you accept this kind of input.
