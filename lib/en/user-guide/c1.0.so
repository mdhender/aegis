.nh 1 "Introduction"
.LP
Aegis is a CASE tool with a difference.
In the spirit of the
.UX
Operating System,
Aegis is a small component designed to work with other programs.
.LP
Many CASE systems attempt to provide everything,
from bubble charts to source control to compilers.
Users are trapped with the components supplied by the CASE system,
and if you don't like one of the components (it may be too limited,
for instance), then that is just tough.
.LP
In contrast,
.UX
provides many components of a CASE system - compilers,
editors, dependency tools (such as make), source control (such as SCCS).
You may substitute the tool of your choice - gcc, jove, cake,
rcs (to name a few) if you don't like the ones supplied with the system.
.LP
Aegis adds to this list with software configuration
management (SCM),
and consistent with
.UX
philosophy,
Aegis does not dictate the choice of any of the other tools
(although it may stretch them to their limits).
