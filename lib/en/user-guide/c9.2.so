.nh 2 "Conflict Resolution"
.LP
A development directory becomes out of date, compared to the project,
when another change is integrated which has a file in common.  This
situation is delected automatically by \fIaede\fP(1) and you resolve it
using \fIaed\fP(1), usually with something like the \fI--merge-only\fP
option.  Aditionally, you can see if you have an out-of-date file from
the \fIchange files\fP listing, because it will show you the current
baseline version in parentheses if you are out-of-date.
.LP
Aegis implements branches as very long changes, with sub-changes.
A side effect of this is that a branch can become out-of-date in the
same way that a development director becomes out of date.  When it
comes to to \fIaede\fP(1) the branch, you will be told if there are
any out-of-date files.  Additionally, the \fIproject files\fP listing
will show out of date files in exactly the same way that the \fIchange
file\fP listing does.
.nh 3 "Cross Branch Merge"
However, unlike a simple change, if you attempt to use the \fIaed
--merge-only\fP command in the branch baseline, you will get an error
message!  Howm, then, do you resolve the apparrent impasse?
.LP
The \fIaed\fP(1) command has a number of options designed for just
this purpose.
.IP \(bu 2n
The \fI--branch\fP option may be used to specify another branch of
the same project, as a source of the file to be differenced against.
This is almost what you need.
.IP \(bu 2n
The \fI--grandparent\fP option is a special case of the \fI--branch\fP
option, and it means the parent branch of project.
.IP \(bu 2n
The \fI--trunk\fP option is also a special case of the \fI--branch\fP
option, and it means the base branch from which the entire branch tree springs.
.LP
By creating a new change on the out-of-date branch, and copying in the
out-of-date files, you have almost everything required.  All that is
necessary is to performa cross-branch merge against the project grandparenmt,
and the necessary merging will be performed.  \fBIn addition\fP Aegis
will remember that it was a cross-branch merge, and once \fIaeipass\fP
completes successfully, the branch will be up-to-date once more.
.IP \(sq 3n
Create a new change on the out-of-date branch
.IP \(sq 3n
Use a simple \fIaecp\fP command to copy the out-of-date files.
(Do \fInot\fP use any \fI--branch\fP or \fI--delta\fP options.)
.IP \(sq 3n
Use the ``\fIaed --merge-only --grandparent\fP'' command to perform the merge.
.IP \(sq 3n
As usualy, use yout favourite editor to check the merge results,
and resolve any conflicts.
.IP \(sq 3n
Build and test as usual.
.IP \(sq 3n
Complete the change as usual.
.IP \(sq 3n
Once \fIaeipass\fP is successful, the branch will be up-to-date (for
the files in the change).
.nh 3 "Insulation"
.LP
One of the stated benefits of using a branch is the insulating effects
which branches can provide.  However, when you have multiple simultaneous
active branches, that insulation will inevitabley lead to out-of-date
branch files.  Now that \fIhow\fP to merge them has been describes,
\fIwhen\fP should you merge?
.LP
In a simple change's development directory, there are times when an
\fIaeipass\fP will result in all developers needing to recompile.
Depending on what files you are working on, it may be that you need to
merge some of your change files immediately, or \fIaecp\fP an earlier
version of the files which changed in the project.
.LP
Branches can also suffer from exactly the same problems, and are
mended by exactly the same alteratives.
.nh 4 "Branch Insulated Against Project"
.LP
If you created a branch to insulate the work being done on the branch
from other activities in the project, it follows that when such build
problems occurred, you would use an ``\fIaecp -delta'' command to
continue insulating.
.LP
This action deferes the labour of merging until towards the end of the
branch development, sometimes with a quite visable shedule impact.
.nh 4 "Project Insulated Against Branch"
.LP
If you created a branch to insulate the project from work
being done in the branch, it follows that you would do a cross branch immediately.
.LP
This action amortizes the labour of merging across the life of the branch,
often with a number of small delays and less schedule impact.
.nh 4 "Mix 'n' Match"
Of course, we usually have both these motives, and some more
besides, so the answer is usually ``it depends''.
