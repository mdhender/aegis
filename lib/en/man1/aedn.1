.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I \*(n)
.I -DELta_NAme
command is used to
add a symbolic name to a project delta.
This is so that this name may be used, rather than the number,
when extracting previous versions of the file
using the
.IR aecp (1)
command.
.PP
The number on the command line is a delta number of the project.
That is, it is the delta number assigned to an integration.
Delta names may only be applied to project baselines.
If no delta number is given on the command line,
the current baseline is the default.
.PP
A name must be given on the command line.
This is the name which will be assigned to the delta.
If the name has already been used,
you will be given a fatal error message.
If you also specify the
.B -OverWriting
option the name will be removed from its previous delta and assigned
to the requested delta.
