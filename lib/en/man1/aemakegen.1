.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fI\*(n)\fP command is used to
generate a \f[CW]Makefile.in\fP file from a file manifest.
The file manifest is the set of file specified on the command line.
.PP
If a project or change number is mentioned on the command line, the
search path and file manifest is derived from Aegis meta-data.  File
names on the command line are considered to be additional files, and
will be added to the manifest.
.PP
If no project or change number is mentioned on the command line, it is
assumed that the files named on the command line are all the files the
makefile is to be generated from.
.SS Project Structure
The \fI\*(n)\fP command assumes a particular project structure.
This is as follows:
.TP 8n
\f[CW]lib/\fP
The \fIlib\fP directory contains C++ files to be compiled, and
placed into the \f[CW]lib/lib.a\fP file, to be linked with the other
executables.
.TP 8n
\fIprog\fP\f[CW]/\fP
Each executable is contained in its own directory.
Which directories contain programs are determined by
the presence of a \f[CW]main.cc\fP file.
.TP 8n
\f[CW]bin/\fP
Each program is compiled and linked, with the executable placed in the
\fIbin\fP directory.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are understood:
.so o_change.so
.so o_output.so
.so o_project.so
.TP 8n
\fB\-SCRipt\fP \f[I]pattern\fP
This option may be used to nominate file which are scripts.  The
patterns are normal shell file name globbing patterns, so you may need
to quote it.  You may use this option more than once.  Scripts in the
\f[CW]script/\fP or \f[CW]scripts/\fP directories will be installed.
Scripts with a basename starting with \f[CW]test_\fP will be build to
support the \[lq]make check\[rq] target.
.TP 8n
\fB\-Search_Path\fP \f[I]directory\fP
The search path option may be used to specify the search path.
This option may be given more than once.
.TP 8n
\fB\-TArget\fP \f[I]name\fP
.RS
The option may be used to select the desired output format by name.
The known names are:
.TP 8n
automake
Generate \f[I]automake\fP(1) input, suitable for use as a top-level
\f[CW]Makefile.am\fP file.
.TP 8n
makefile
Generate \f[I]make\fP(1) input, suitable for as as a top-level
\f[CW]Makefile.in\fP file.  This is the default.
