.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fI\*(n)\fP command is used to
list the files which make up a change.
The file names are printed one per line on the output.
.PP
If there are no files matching your criteria (see below) the output will be
empty, and no error will be issued.
.PP
This is very similar to the \fIaegis -l cf\fP listing,
but it only lists file names, it lists no other attributes,
and it is considerably faster.
.PP
If your filenames have newlines in them, you have a problem.
You can use any of the
\fIposix_\%filename_\%charset\fP,
\fIdos_\%filename_\%required\fP,
\fIwindows_\%filename_\%required\fP, or
\fIshell_\%safe_\%filenames\fP
fields in your project configuration file to prevent this.
See \fIaenf\fP(1) and \fIaepconf\fP(5) for more information.
