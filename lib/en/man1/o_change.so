.TP 8n
\fB-Change\fP \fInumber\fP
This option may be used to specify a particular change within a project.
When no
.B -Change
option is specified,
the
.I AEGIS_CHANGE
environment variable is consulted.
If that does not exist,
the user's
.I $HOME/.aegisrc
file is examined for a default change field (see
.IR aeuconf (5)
for more information).
If that does not exist,
when the user is only working on one change within a project,
that is the default change number.
Otherwise,
it is an error.
