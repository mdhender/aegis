.SS Changing the Type of a File
If you want to change the type of a file (say, from a test to a source
file, or \fIvice versa\fP) you could do it as two changes, by first using
\fIaerm\fP(1) in one change and then using \fIaenf\fP(1) or \fIaent\fP(1)
in a second change, or you can combine both steps in the same change.
Remember to use the \fIaerm -nowhiteout\fP option or you will get a most
peculiar new file template.
