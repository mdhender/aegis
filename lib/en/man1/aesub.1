.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I \*(n)
command is used to perform the usual \fIaesub\fP(5) substitutions on
its command line arguments, and then echo them to the standard output.
.SS Shell Script Quoting
The \fIaesub\fP(1) command is often used in shell scripts.  It is
important to remember that the shell will do its own substitutions on the
command line argument \fIbefore\fP it invokes the \fIaesub\fP(1) command.
Usually, you don't want this to happen, so you need to use \fIsingle\fP
(\f(CW'\fP) quotes to do this.  (The shell continues to substitute inside
double (\f(CW"\fP) quotes.)
.PP
Quote \fIaesub\fP(1) arguments using \f(CW'\fP \fIsingle\fP \f(CW'\fP quotes.
