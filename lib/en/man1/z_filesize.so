.SS File Name Limitations
There are a number of controls available to limit the form of project
file names.  All of these controls may be found in the project
.I config
file, see
.IR aepconf (5)
for more information.
The most significant are briefly described here:
.TP 8n
maximum_filename_length = integer;
This field is used to limit the length of filenames.
All new files may not have path components longer than this.
Defaults to 255 if not set.
For maximum portability you should set this to 14.
.TP 8n
posix_filename_charset = boolean;
This field may be used to limit the characters allowed
in filenames to only those explicitly allowed by POSIX.
Defaults to
.I false
if not set, meaning whatever your operating system will tolerate,
except white space and high-bit-on characters.
For maximum portability you should set this to \fItrue\fP.
.TP 8n
dos_filename_required = boolean;
This field may be used to limit filenames so that they conform to
the DOS 8+3 filename limits and to the DOS filename character set.
Defaults to
.I false
if not set.
.TP 8n
windows_filename_required = boolean;
This field may be used to limit filenames so that they conform to the
Windows98 and WindowsNT filename limits and character set.  Defaults to
\fIfalse\fP if not set.
.TP 8n
shell_safe_filenames = boolean;
This field may be used to limit filenames so that they do not contain
shell special characters.  Defaults to
.I true
if not set.  If this field is set to
.IR false ,
you will need to use the
.I ${quote}
substitution around filenames in commands, to ensure that filenames
containing shell special characters do not have unintended side effects.
Weird characters in filenames may also confuse your dependency maintenance tool.
.TP 8n
filename_pattern_accept = [ string ];
This field is used to specify a list of patterns of acceptable filenames.
Defaults to "*" if not set.
.TP 8n
filename_pattern_reject = [ string ];
.br
This field is used to specify a list of patterns of unacceptable filenames.
