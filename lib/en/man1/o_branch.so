.\" MANIFEST: description of the -BRanch command line option
.\"
.TP 8n
\fB-BRanch\fP \fInumber\fP
This option may be used to specify a
different branch for the origin file,
rather than the baseline.
(See also \fB\-TRunk\fP option.\)
Please Note: the \fB-BRanch\fP option does not take a project name,
just the branch number suffix.
.TP 8n
\fB\-GrandParent\fP
This option may be used to specify the grandparent branch (one up from
the current branch) for the origin file, rather than the baseline.
(The \-grandparent option is the same as the \[lq]\-branch ..\[rq] option.)
