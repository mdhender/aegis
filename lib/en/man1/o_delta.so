\fB-DELta\fP \fInumber\fP
.br
This option may be used to specify a particular
delta in the project's history to copy the file from,
rather than the most current version.
If the delta has been given a name
(see
.IR aedn (1)
for how)
you may use a delta name instead of a delta number.
It is an error if the delta specified does not exist.
Delta numbers start from 1 and increase;
delta 0 is a special case meaning \[lq]when the branch started\[rq].

\fB-DELta_Date\fP \fIstring\fP

version.  It is an error if the string specified cannot be interpreted
as a valid date and time.  Quote the string if you need to use spaces.
