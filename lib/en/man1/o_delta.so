\fB-DELta\fP \fInumber\fP
.br
This option may be used to specify a particular
delta in the project's history to copy the file from,
rather than the most current version.
If the delta has been given a name
(see
.IR aedn (1)
for how)
you may use a delta name instead of a delta number.
It is an error if the delta specified does not exist.
Delta numbers start from 1 and increase;
delta 0 is a special case meaning ``when the branch started''.
.TP 8n
\fB-DELta_Date\fP \fIstring\fP
.br
This option may be used to specify a particular date and time in the
project's history to copy the file from, rather than the most current
version.  It is an error if the string specified cannot be interpreted
as a valid date and time.  Quote the string if you need to use spaces.
