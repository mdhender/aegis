.\" MANIFEST: document describing symbolic link verification options
.\"
.TP 8n
\fB\-Verify_Symbolic_Links\fP
This option may be used to request that the symbolic links, or hard
links, or file copies, in the work area be updated to reflect the
current state of the baseline.
This is controlled by the \fIdevelopment_\%directory_\%style\fP field of
the project configuration file.
Only files which are not involved in the change are updated.
See also the ``symbolic_links_preference'' field of \fIaeuconf\fP(5).
This option is the default, if meaningful for your configuration.
The name is an historical accident, hard links and file copies are included.
.TP 8n
\fB\-Assume_Symbolic_Links\fP
This option may be used to request that no update of baseline mirror
files take place.
This options is useful when you \fIdefinitely know\fP the files'
up-to-date-ness isn't important right now; incorrect use of this option
may have unanticipated build side-effects.
See also the ``symbolic_links_preference'' field of \fIaeuconf\fP(5).
This option is the default, if not meaningful for your configuration.
The name is an historical accident, hard links and file copies are included.
