.SS Example
Aliases may be used in may ways.  The most common is to give a particular
release a code name.  You would do this by saying
.RS
.ft CW
aenpa example.4.2 sydney
.ft R
.RE
This would make ``sydney'' an alias for the ``example.4.2'' branch.
.PP
Another use for aliases is to have a fixed alias for your active branch,
so that your developer team does not need to change their default project,
even though the branch number moves on for each release.  You could say
.RS
.ft CW
aenpa example.4.2 example.cur
.ft R
.RE
This would make ``example.cur'' an alias for the ``example.4.2'' branch.
When this was finished, and 4.3 started, a project administrator could say
.RS
.ft CW
aerpa example.cur
.br
aenpa example.4.3 example.cur
.ft R
.RE
Now ``example.cur'' is an alias for the ``example.4.3'' branch, but the
developers need only reference ``example.cur'' to always work on the
right branch.
