.SH NAME
aeget \- Aegis CGI file access
.XX "aeget(1)" "Aegis CGI file access"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B \*(n)
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I "\*(n)"
command is used with Apache (or CGI conforming any other web server)
to access the files of an Aegis project.
The files are searched for along the appropriate search path,
including all ancestor baslines,
not just the baseline of the branch.
.PP
This is useful when developing web sites using Aegis.
.SS Install
In order to use \fIaeget\fP(1), you need to copy it into your
\fIcgi-bin\fP directory.
.PP
You may prefer to use a symbolic link, as this will be more stable
across Aegis upgrades.  However, this requires a corresponding
\fIfollow-symlinks\fP setting in your web server's configuration file.
.SS Usage
Once \fIaeget\fP(1) is installed,
files may be accessed via
.RS
http://localhost/cgi-bin/aeget/\fIproject-name\fP/
.RE
If no project name is given, a list of projects will be generated.
This will lead you through a series of menus, giving access to manu
useful pages of information about your projects.
.SS Cascading Style Sheets
The web interface uses Cascading Style Sheets.  You can give the
web interface a personalised look and feel, by creating stylesheets
in the web server's Document Root directory.
The interface will use it's default styles, then styles from a global
style sheet called \f[CW]aedefault.css\fP, and then styles from a project
stylesheet called \fIprojectname\fP\f[CW].css\fP (replace \fIprojectname\fP
with the name of the project).
.PP
There is an example style sheet in
\f[CW]\*(B)/aedefault.css\fP which demonstrates the style elements used.
This particular stylesheet is not designed to be aesthetically pleasing,
but to exercise all of the elements.
Using this stylesheet unmodified will give psychedelic results.
Use it as a template.
.SH PROJECT ATTRIBUTES
You can set your own project specific page headers and footers by using
the "html:meta", "html:body-begin" and "html:body-end" project specific
attributes.
.RS
.nf
.ft CW
project_specific =
[
  {
    name = "html:body-begin";
.fi
.in +4m
value = "<i>This text goes immediately after the &lt;BODY&gt; and before
any text generated by <i>aeget</i>(1).</i>";
.in -4m
.nf
  },
  {
    name = "html:body-end";
.fi
.in +4m
value = "<i>This text goes immediately before the &lt;/BODY&gt; and after
all text generated by <i>aeget</i>(1).</i>";
.in -4m
.nf
  },
];
.ft P
.fi
.RE
These fields may be used to customize your web pages for your
project-specific or company-specific needs.
Each project is configured independently.
.SH CHANGE ATTRIBUTES
If you wish to prevent a change set appearing in the change set
inventory used by \fIaedist -replay\fP to determine what needs to be
downloaded, set the following change set attribute:
.RS
.nf
.ft CW
attribute =
[
  {
    name = "aeget:inventory:hide";
    value = "true";
  },
];
.ft P
.fi
.RE
You must use the \fIaeca\fP(1) command for this, the \fItkaeca\fP(1)
command can not edit change set attributes.
