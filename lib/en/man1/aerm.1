.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I \*(n)
.I -ReMove_file
command is used to
add files to be deleted to a change.
The file will be added to the list of files in the change,
and will be removed from the baseline at integration time.
.PP
This command may be used to remove tests,
not just source files.
Tests are treated just like any other source file,
and are subject to the same process.
.PP
A file will be created in the development directory containing 1KB of
random text.  The random text is sufficiently revolting that most
compilers will give error messages, should the file be referenced
accidentally.  This is often very helpful when removing include files.
.PP
You may specify a directory name to remove all
files in the named directory tree.
It is an error if there are no relevant files.
.so z_intuit.so
.SS Process Side Effects
This command will cancel any build or test registrations,
because adding a file logically invalidates them.
.PP
When the change files are listed
(\fI\*(n) -List Change_Files -TERse\fP)
the removed files will not appear in the terse listing.
Similarly,
when the project files are listed with an explicit change number
(\fI\*(n) -List Project_Files -TERse -Change\fP \f(CWN\fP)
none of the change's files,
including the the removed files,
will not appear in the terse listing.
These two features are very helpful when calling \*(n) from within
a DMT to generate the list of source files.
.so z_retype.so
.SS Notification
The \fIremove_file_command\fP in the project \fIconfig\fP file is run,
if set.  The \fIproject_\%file_\%command\fP is also run, if set, and
if there has been an integration recently.  See \fIaepconf\fP(5) for
more information.
