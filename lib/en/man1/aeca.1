.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I \*(n)
.I -Change_Attributes
command is used to set, edit or list the attributes of a change.
.PP
The output of the
.B -List
variant is suitable for use as input at a later time.
.PP
See
.IR aecattr (5)
for a description of the file format.
.PP
The \f[I]name\fP\fB=\fP\f[I]value\fP form of the command may be used when
you wish to add or modify change set attributes.  If an attribute
is already present, it will be modified; if there is more than one
attribute with the same name, only the first will be modified.
The \f[I]name\fP\fB+=\fP\f[I]value\fP form will always append the pair.
.SS Example
When you edit the file, you will see something like this:
.RS
.nf
.ft CW
brief_description = "login(1) is too fussy";
description = "When users type their password "
    "incorrectly, after three times the login(1) "
    "program should assume they have forgotten "
    "their password and automatically reset it "
    "for them.";
cause = external_enhancement;
attribute =
[
    {
        name = "bugzilla";
        value = "666";
    },
    {
        name = "customer-priority";
        value = "high";
    },
    {
        name = "marketing-priority";
        value = "urgent-panic-headless-chicken";
    },
    {
        name = "engineering-priority";
        value = "after-heat-death-of-universe";
    }
];
.ft R
.fi
.RE
Note the semicolons, you need to get them right.
Edit the fields you want to change.
When you quit the editor, they will be updated.
.SS Known Attribute Names
While many of the anticipated used of change attributes are to allow
projects to attach their own specialized data to change sets, Aegis also
uses some attributes for its own purposes (and arguably, should always
have done so to maximize forwards compatibility across Aegis upgrades).
.TP 8n
aeget:inventory:hide
boolean.  If true, this change set does not appear in \f[I]aeget\fP(1)'s
change set inventory pages, used by \f[I]aedist -replay\fP to decide what
to download and apply.  Think of it as a "local only" flag.
.TP 8n
foreign-copyright
boolean.  If true, none of the files in this change set will not be
checked by the \f[I]aede-policy\fP(1) \f[CW]copyright\fP validation.
.TP 8n
original-uuid
This is set by \f[I]aedist -receive\fP when an incoming change set
is changed before it can end development.
There may be more than one.
The \f[I]aeget\fP(1) inventory "all" page will show these
additional UUIDs, used by the \f[I]aedist \-pending\fP command..
.SS Universal Unique Identifier
Each change set is assigned a unique universal identifier (UUID) at
\f[I]integrate pass\fP time.  This serves to identify the change across
all sites when a geographically distributed development model is being
used.  This may be exploited to rapidly determine which change sets need
to be downloaded.
.PP
The \fB\-Universal_Unique_IDentifier\fP option is used by the
\f[I]aedist\fP(1) and \f[I]aepatch\fP(1) commands to set the UUID of a
change set.  It should not be used by developers.
.SS Using Change Attributes in Scripts
There are several ways you can use the attributes of an Aegis change in
a shell script:
.TP 8n
\f[I]aereport\fP(1)
The report generator is able to access change attributes.
You can then have the report generator print the necessary data.
.TP 8n
\f[I]aesub\fP(1)
Many change attributes can be accessed via the \f[I]aesub\fP(5) command
substitutions, and printed using the \f[I]aesub\fP(1) command.
.TP 8n
aeca -l
The list option of the \f[I]aeca\fP(1) command may be used to print the
values of all editable change attributes.  It can be groped using
\f[I]grep\fP(1) or \f[I]awk\fP(1), or similar.
.TP 8n
\f[I]aexml\fP(1)
It is possible to get a great deal of information in XML format,
including change attributes.  This format can be parsed by a variety of
packages.
.PP
Use the method best suited to your particular needs.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are understood:
.so o_change.so
.TP 8n
\fB\-Description_Only\fP
This option may be used to specify that only the change description is
the subject of this command.  It will be presented as plain text, without
any of the quotes or escapes present when this command is not used.
.so o_edit.so
.so o_file.so
.TP 8n
\-Fix_ARchitecture
This option may be used to replace change change's architecture list with
all of the mandatory architectures from the project configuration file,
plus any of the optional architectures that match the current machine.
May not be used with \-file or \-edit options.
.so o_help.so
.so o_list.so
.so o_project.so
.so o_terse.so
.so o_verbose.so
.TP 8n
\fB\-Universal_Unique_IDentifier\fP \f[I]string\fP
This option may be used to set the UUID of change change.
.so o_wait.so
.so o__rules.so
.SH RECOMMENDED ALIAS
The recommended alias for this command is
.nf
.ta 8n 16n
csh%	alias aeca '\*(n) -ca \e!* -v'
sh$	aeca(){\*(n) -ca "$@" -v}
.fi
