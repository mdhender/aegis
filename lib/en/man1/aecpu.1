.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I \*(n)
.I -CoPy_file_Undo
command is used to
delete files previously copied into a change.
The named files will be removed from the list of files in the change.
.PP
The file is deleted from the development directory
unless the
.B -Keep 
option is specified.
The 
.B -Keep
option should be used with great care,
as you can confuse tools such as
.IR make (1)
by leaving these files in place.
.PP
You may name a directory to delete from the change all files
in that directory tree previously copied into the change,
other files in the tree will be ignored.
It is an error if there are no relevant files.
.so z_intuit.so
.SS Process Side Effects
This command will cancel any build or test registrations,
because deleting a file logically invalidates them.
If the project
.I config
file was deleted,
any diff registration will also be canceled.
.PP
The difference file (\f(CW,D\fP) will also be removed,
however any DMT derived files
(e.g a \f(CW.o\fP file from a \f(CW.c\fP file)
will not be removed.
This is because \*(n) is decoupled from the DMT,
and cannot know what these derived file may be called.
You may need to delete derived files manually.
.SS Notification
The \fIcopy_file_undo_command\fP in the project \fIconfig\fP file is
run, if set.  The \fIproject_\%file_\%command\fP is also run, if set,
and if there has been an integration recently.  See \fIaepconf\fP(5)
for more information.
