.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I \*(n)
.I -New_File_Undo
command is used to
remove new files from a change
(reverse the actions of the '\*(n) -New_File' command).
The file is removed from the list of files in the change.
.PP
The file is removed from the development directory
unless the
.B -Keep
option is used.
The
.B -Keep
option should be used with great care,
as you can confuse tools such as
.IR make (1)
by leaving these files in place.
.PP
You may specify a directory name to remove all
new files in the named directory tree,
other files in the tree will be ignored.
It is an error if there are no relevant files.
.so z_intuit.so
.SS Notification
The \fInew_\%file_\%undo_\%command\fP in the project \fIconfig\fP file is
run, if set.  The \fIproject_\%file_\%command\fP is also run, if set,
and if there has been an integration recently.  See \fIaepconf\fP(5)
for more information.
.SS Process Side Effects
This command will cancel any build or test registrations,
because deleting a file logically invalidates them.
.PP
The difference file (\f(CW,D\fP) will also be removed,
however any DMT derived files
(e.g a \f(CW.o\fP file from a \f(CW.c\fP file)
will not be removed.
This is because \*(n) is decoupled from the DMT,
and cannot know what these derived file may be called.
You may need to delete derived files manually.
