.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I \*(n)
.I -Develop_Begin
command is used to
commence development of a change.
.PP
The development directory for the change will be created automatically;
below the directory specified in the default_\%development_\%directory
field of
.IR aeuconf (5),
or if not set
below the directory specified in the default_\%development_\%directory
field of
.IR aepattr (5),
or if not set
below the current user's home directory.
It is rare to need to know the exact pathname of the
development directory,
as the
.IR aecd (1)
command can take you there at any time.
.PP
Successful execution of this command will move the
specified change from the
.I "awaiting development"
state to the
.I "being developed"
state.

.SS Notification
The
.I develop_begin_command
in the project configuration file
(see
.IR aepconf (5)
for more information) will be run, if specified.  This is run after the
aegis locks are released, so additional aegis commands may be run from
here, if used with care.  The symbolic links (see below) have \fInot\fP
yet been created.

.SH ADMINISTRATOR OVERRIDE
It is possible for project administrators to use the
.B -User
option to force a developer to start developing a change.
Some sites prefer to work this way.
Note that developers still have the ability to use the
.IR aedbu (1)
command.
.PP
Warning:
capricious use of this command will rapidly alienate developers.
The defaulting rules, particularly for the change number,
depend on \*(n) and the developer agreeing on
what the developer is currently working on.
.PP
The
.I forced_\%develop_\%begin_\%notify_\%command
project attribute (see
.IR aepattr (5)
for more information)
will be run when an administrator uses the
.B -User
option,
in an attempt to minimize the surprises for developers.
A suitable command is
.RS
.nf
\f(CWforced_develop_begin_notify_command =
    "$datadir/db_forced.sh $p $c $developer";\fP
.fi
.RE
This command will send e-mail to the developer,
informing her that the change has been assigned to her.
