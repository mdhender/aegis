.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I "\*(n) -Make_Transparent"
command is used to
add a file to the change which will result in the named file being made
transparent in the branch when the change is integrated.
The version of the project file from the deeper branch will then show through.
.PP
You may name a directory to make all files
in that directory tree transparent.
It is an error if there are no relevant files.
.SS Branch \fIvs\fP Change
The \fIaecpu\fP(1) command may only be applied to a change.  If you
wish to perform the same operation on a branch, use the \fIaemt\fP(1)
command, through the agency of a change.
.so z_intuit.so
.SS Process Side Effects
This command will cancel any build or test registrations,
because changing the change file list logically invalidates them.
.\" If the project
.\" configuration
.\" file was made transparent,
.\" any diff registration will also be canceled.
.SS Notification
The \fImake_transparent_command\fP in the project configuration file is
run, if set.  The \fIproject_\%file_\%command\fP is also run, if set,
and if there has been an integration recently.  See \fIaepconf\fP(5)
for more information.

This command is dedicated to my wife, Mary-Therese.  When I was trying
to explain what this command did, she said "I had one of those on my
bicycle when I was young, but it fell off".
