.SH NAME
\*(n) -CLEan \- clean files from development directory
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I "\*(n) -CLEan"
command is used to remove all files which are not change source files
from a development directory.  This can be used to obtain a ``clean''
development directory before a final build, to ensure that a change is
ready to end development.
A new build will be required.
.PP
All symbolic links will be removed from the development directory,
even if \fIremove_\%symlinks_\%after_\%build = false\fP in the
project \fIconfig\fP file.  The symbolic links will be re-installed,
if \fIcreate_\%symlinks_\%before_\%build = true\fP.  This is to ensure
that the symlinks are accurate, and that unnecassary ones are removed.
.PP
All special device files, pipes and sockets will be removed.  These files
cannot be source files, and it is expected that the following build will
restore them.
.PP
All derived files created by previous builds of the change will be
removed.  It is expected that the following build will recreate them.
Any temporary files you may have created in the development directory
will also be removed.
.PP
The
.I develop_begin_command
in the project config file
(see
.IR aepconf (5)
for more information) will be run, if there is one.
The
.I change_file_command
will be run, if there is one.
The
.I project_file_command
will be run, if there is one.
.PP
You will be warned if any of the files are out-of-date and need to be merged.
You will be warned if any files need to be differenced.

.SH OPTIONS
The following options are understood:
.so o_change.so
.so o_help.so
.so o_list.so
.so o_nolog.so
.TP 8n
.B \-MINIMum
.RS
This option may be used to request a minimum set of symbolic links,
when the \fIcreate_symlinks_to_baseline\fP functions are being used.
This is useful if you want to simulate something like \fIaeib -minimum\fP
in the development directory.  This option is not meaningful if symbolic
links are not being used.
.PP
This option also says not to remove normals files which occlude project
source files.  This is a common technique used to temporarily over-ride
a project source files.  The ``\fIaecp -read-only'' command would have
been more appropriate.
