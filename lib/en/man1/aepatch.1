.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I "\*(n)"
command is used to
send Aegis changes as patches, or receive patches and turn them into
Aegis changes.
.PP
Please note that this only works for text files.  If your project uses
binary files, the \fI\*(n)\fP program, will not be useful, because the
\fIdiff\fP(1) and \fIpatch\fP(1) commands only work on text files.
Also, this only works for files with names which do not contain white space.
.SS Notification
The \fI\*(n)\fP command invokes various other Aegis commands.
The usual notifications that these commands would issue are issued.
.PP
If you need to merge matches together, you could use the GNU patch utils,
which include a tool to merge patches together.
