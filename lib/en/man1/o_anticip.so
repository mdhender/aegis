.br
This option is used to nominate a source for the reference files,
rather than the baseline.
This may be used to synchronize with a change without
having to wait for it to arrive in the baseline.
It is an error if the anticipated change is not in one of the
.I "'being reviewed'"
or
.I "'awaiting integration'"
or
.I "'being integrated'"
states.
A merge is always performed,
because the anticipated change is "about" to make
any common file out-of-date.
You will still have to perform a "real" merge later.
