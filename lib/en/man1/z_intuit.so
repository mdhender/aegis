.SS File Name Interpretation
The \*(n) program will attempt to determine the project file names
from the file names given on the command line.
All file names are stored within \*(n) projects as relative to
the root of the baseline directory tree.
The development directory and the integration directory are shadows of
this baseline directory, and so these relative names apply here, too.
Files named on the command line
are first converted to absolute paths if necessary.
They are then compared with the baseline path,
the development directory path,
and the integration directory path,
to determine a baseline-relative name.
It is an error if the file named is outside
one of these directory trees.
.PP
The \fB-BAse_RElative\fP option may be used to cause relative filenames
to be interpreted as relative to the baseline path; absolute filenames
will still be compared with the various paths in order to determine a
baseline-relative name.
.PP
The \fIrelative_filename_preference\fP in the user configuration file
may be used to modify this default behavior.  See \fIaeuconf\fP(5) for
more information.
