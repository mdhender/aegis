.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I \*(n)
.I -Integrate_Pass
command is used to
notify \*(n) that a change has passed integration.
The change is advanced
from the
.I "being integrated"
state to the
.I "completed"
state.
.PP
This command updates the file histories, so that future
.IR aecp (1)
commands may extract previous file versions from history,
and so that future
.IR aed (1)
commands may merge out-of-date files.
The history is updated using the
.I history_create_command
and
.I history_put_command
fields of the project
.I config
file (see
.IR aepconf (5)
for more information).  The integrate pass will abort with an error if
one of these history commands should fail, \fIe.g.\fP by running out of disk
space.  If this should happen, the change will remain in the
.I "being integrated"
state, and the integration directory is unaltered.
.SH History Tools Modify Files
Many history tools (\fIe.g.\fP RCS and SCCS) can modify the contents of
the file when it is committed.  This usually requies the use of specific
\&``keyword'' strings, and there are usually options to turn this behavior
off, but users familiar with version control tools (as opposed to
configuration management systems) will often use these features.
The problem is that if the commit changes the file, the source file in
the repository now no longer matches the object file in the repository.
.I I.e.
the history tool has compromised the referential integrity of the
repository.  By default, a fatal error is emitted if the file is changed
by the check-in, however this can be modified to a be warning or even
ignored completely; see the
.I history_\%put_\%trashes_\%file\fP
field of
.IR aepconf (5)
for more information.
.PP
Once the history has been updated, the integration directory is renamed
as the baseline directory, and the old baseline directory is deleted.
The modification times of all files modified since the beginning of
integration (see
.IR aeib (1)
for more information) are updated to be since the beginning of integrate
pass.  The order of modification times will be preserved, however the
time range will be compressed to the greatest extent possible.  This
ensures that subsequent development builds will notice that baseline
files have changed.
.PP
Once integrate pass is complete
the change is no longer assigned to the current user.
.so z_bl_lock.so
.SS The History Lock
Where a project has a number of branches active simultaneously, it is
possible for independent integrate pass commands for different branches
to be issued very close together.
The is an exclusive
.I "history lock"
taken by integrate pass to ensure that only one branch is
updating the file history at a time,
thus preventing history file corruption.
