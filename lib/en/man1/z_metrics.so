.SH METRICS
Aegis is capable of recording metrics as part of the file attributes of
a change.  This allows various properties of files to be recorded for
later trend analysis, or other uses.
.PP
The specific metrics are not dictated by Aegis.  It is expected that
the integration build will create a metrics file for each of the source
files the change.  These metrics files must be in the format specified
by \fIaemetrics\fP(5).
.PP
The name of the metrics file defaults to \[lq]\fIfilename\fP\fB,S\fP\[rq],
however it may be varied, by setting the \fImetrics_\%filename_\%pattern\fP
field of the project \fIconfig\fP file.  See \fIaepconf\fP(5) for more
information.
.PP
If such a metrics file exists, for each source file in a change, it will
be read and remembered at integrate pass time.  If it does not exist,
Aegis assumes there are no relevant metrics for that file, and proceeds
silently; it is not an error.
