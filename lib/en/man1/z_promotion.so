.SS File Action Adjustment
When this command runs, it first checks the change files against the
projects files.  If there are inconsistencies, the file actions will be
adjusted as follows:
.TP 8n
create
If a file is being created, but another change set is integrated which
also creates the file, the file action in the change set still being
developed will be adjusted to "modify".
.TP 8n
modify
If a file is being modified, but another change set is integrated
which removes the file, the file action in the change set still being
developed will be adjusted to "create".
.TP 8n
remove
If a file is being removed, but another change set is integrated which
removes the file, the file will be dropped from the change set still
being developed.
