\fB\-WhiteOut\fP
This option may be used to request that deleted files be replaced by
a \[lq]whiteout\[rq] file in the development directory.  The idea is that
compiling such a file will result in a fatal error, in order that all
references may be found.  This is usually the default.

\fB\-No_WhiteOut\fP
This option may be used to request that no \[lq]whiteout\[rq] file be placed
in the development directory.
