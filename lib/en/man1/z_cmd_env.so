When commands are executed by Aegis, it ensures that the
AEGIS_PROJECT, AEGIS_CHANGE, AEGIS_ARCH, LINES and COLS environment
variables are set appropriately.  The project configuration file's
\fIproject_\%specific\fP field is also consulted, looking for value's
whose name starts with "setenv:" and sets the corresponding environment
variable.  All of the substitutions described by
.IR aesub (5)
are available.
For example: specifying a PATH and a SEARCH_PATH to be used for all commands
may be set as follows:
.RS
.nf
.ft CW
project_specific =
[
  {
    name = "setenv:PATH";
    value = "/usr/bin:/bin";
  },
  {
    name = "setenv:SEARCH_PATH";
    value = "${search_path}";
  },
];
.ft P
.fi
.RE
As many environment variables as desired may be specified in this way.
