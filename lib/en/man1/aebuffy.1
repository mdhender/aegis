.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fI\*(n)\fP command is used to
watch for changes which the current user may be able to act upon.
These include changes being developed by the user, and changes which
could be reviewed or integrated by the user.
.PP
If you don't use the \fIproject-name\fP command line option,
you need to set the AEGIS_PROJECT environment variable, or the
default_project field of the \fI\&.aegisrc\fP file before you invoke
this command.  This is especially important if you launch it from your
X11 session start-up file.
.PP
At the moment it can only watch one project.
If you are good at Tcl/Tk, improvements
are most welcome.
