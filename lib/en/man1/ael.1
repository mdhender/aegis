.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I \*(n)
.I -List
command is used to
list information.
There are a number of possible
.IR list-name s,
as follows (abbreviations as for command line options):
.TP 8n
Administrators
.br
List the administrators of a project.
.TP 8n
Branch_Details
.br
List full information about all the changes in the branch in large
format.  This listing will recurse down the full branch tree.
.TP 8n
Change_Details
.br
List full information about a change
in large format.
.TP 8n
Change_Files
.br
List all files in a change.
The verbose version includes details such as the action being taken,
the edit number of the file, and whether it's being moved.
The terse version only lists the files names (and omits removed files),
this is useful for shell scripts and interfacing with build tools.
.TP 8n
Change_File_History
.br
This listing shows the history of each file in the change.  It includes
each delta number (so that you may reproduce it) and brief description,
of each change which affected each file.
.TP 8n
Change_File_INventory
.br
This listing shows the filenames and their corresponding UUIDs.
When a file is renamed, its UUID remains constant.
(If the UUID column has the filename in it, this is a backwards
compatibility value, for accessing the file history.)

List all files in the baseline of a project.
The verbose version includes details such as the action being taken,

.TP 8n
