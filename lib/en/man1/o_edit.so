.B -Edit
.br
Edit the attributes with a text editor,
this is usually more convenient than supplying a text file.
The
.I VISUAL
and then
.I EDITOR
environment variables are consulted for the name of the editor
to use;
defaults to
.IR vi (1)
if neither is set.
Warning:
tries to be well behaved when faced with errors,
the temporary file is left in your home directory.
This option may not be used in the background,
or when the standard input is not a terminal.
.TP 8n
.B -Edit_BackGround
.br
Edit the attributes with a dumb text editor, this is most often desired
when edit commands are being piped into the editor via the standard
input.  Only the
.I EDITOR
environment variable is consulted for the name of the editor to use; it
is a fatal error if it is not set.
