Edit the attributes with a text editor, this is usually more convenient
than supplying a text file.  The \fIVISUAL\fP and then \fPEDITOR\fP
environment variables are consulted for the name of the editor to use;
defaults to \fIvi\fP(1) if neither is set.
See the \fIvisual_\%command\fP and \fIeditor_\%command\fP fields in
\fIaeuconf\fP(1) for how to override this specifically for Aegis.

Warning: Aegis tries to be well behaved when
faced with errors, so the temporary file is left in your home directory
where you can edit it further and re-use it with a \fB\-file\fP option.
.PP
The \fB\-edit\fP option may not be used in the background, or when the
standard input is not a terminal.

Edit the attributes with a dumb text editor, this is most often desired
when edit commands are being piped into the editor via the standard input.
Only the \fPEDITOR\fP environment variable is consulted for the name of
the editor to use; it is a fatal error if it is not set.
See the \fIeditor_\%command\fP field in \fIaeuconf\fP(1) for how to
override this specifically for Aegis.
