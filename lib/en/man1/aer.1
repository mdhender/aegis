.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I \*(n)
command is used to
generate reports from \*(n)' database.
Reports are specified in a C-like language
described in the
.IR aer (5)
manual entry.
.PP
For a list of the reports available on your system,
use the '\fIaer -list\fP' command.
These reports live in the
.I \*(D)/report
directory,
and it initially contains the reports distributed with \*(n),
however sites are free to add their own here.
.SH WRITING REPORT SCRIPTS
Getting started writing report scripts can be difficult.  You are best to
have a look at the reports distributes with Aegis, and try to adapt them.
The report script files are kept in the \fI\*(D)/report\fP directory.
.PP
For information about the data structures which may be accessed from a
report script, you need to see the relevant manual entries:
.TP 8n
the projects list
See \fIaegstate\fP(1) for the member fields.
.TP 8n
a specific project
See \fIaepstate\fP(1) for the member fields.
.TP 8n
a specific change
See \fIaecstate\fP(1) for the member fields.
.TP 8n
a specific file
See \fIaefstate\fP(1) for the member fields.
.PP
Each of the above man pages also contains a section towards the end which
specifically addresses report generator use, usually with code fragments.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are understood:
.so o_change.so
.TP 8n
\fB-File\fP \fIfilename\fP
.br 
Take the report script from the specified file, rather than looking for
the named report in the library of reports distributed with \*(N).
The filename `-' is understood to mean the standard input.
