\fB-Project\fP \fIname\fP
This option may be used to select the project of interest.
When no
.B -Project
option is specified,
the
.I AEGIS_PROJECT
environment variable is consulted.
If that does not exist,
the user's
.I $HOME/.aegisrc
file is examined for a default project field (see
.IR aeuconf (5)
for more information).
If that does not exist,
when the user is only working on changes within a single project,
the project name defaults to that project.
Otherwise,
it is an error.
