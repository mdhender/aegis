.\" MANIFEST: document describing file location limitations
.\"
\fBPlease Note:\fP Aegis also consults the underlying file system, to
determine its notion of maximum file size.  Where the file system's
maximum file size is less than \fImaximum_filename_length\fP, the
filesystem wins.  This can happen, for example, when you are using the
Linux UMSDOS file system, or when you have an NFS mounted an ancient
V7 filesystem.  Setting \fImaximum_filename_length\fP to 255 in these
cases does not alter the fact that the underlying file systems limits
are far smaller (12 and 14, respectively).
.PP
If your development directories (or your whole project) is on filesystems
with filename limitations, or a portion of the heterogeneous builds take
place in such an environment, it helps to tell Aegis what they are (using
the project \fIconfig\fP file's fields) so that you don't run into the
situation where the project builds on the more permissive environments,
but fails with mysterious errors in the more limited environments.
.PP
If your development directories are routinely on a Linux
UMSDOS filesystem, you would probably be better off setting
\fIdos_filename_required = true\fP,
and also changing the \fIdevelopment_directory_template\fP field.
Heterogenous development with various Windows environments may
also require this.
