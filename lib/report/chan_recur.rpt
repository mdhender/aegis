 * MANIFEST: recursive descent of change data structures
 *
 * This report is primarily of use in debugging, but can also
 * demonstrate the shape of the internal data structures available to a
 * report author.  If you are expluring a specific sub-section of the
 * data tree, the best idea its to copy this report and then mangle the
 * thing first placed on the stack.
