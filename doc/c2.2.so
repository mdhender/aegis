.nh 2 "The Reviewer"
.LP
The role of a reviewer is to check another user's work.
You are helped in this by aegis,
because changes can never reach the
.I "being reviewed"
state without several preconditions:
.LP
\(bu The change is know to build.
You know that it compiled successfully,
so there is no need to search for syntax errors.
.LP
\(bu The change has tests,
and those tests have been run,
and have passed.
.LP
This information allows you to concentrate on implementation issues,
completeness issues,
and local standards issues.
.LP
To help the reviewer,
a set of "command D" files is available
in the change development directory.
Every files which is to be added to the baseline, 
removed from the baseline,
or changed in some way,
has a corresponding "comma D" file.
.nh 3 "The First Change"
.LP
Robyn finds out what changes are available for review
by asking aegis:
.E(
robyn% \f(CBaerpass -l -p example\fP

Project "example"
List of Changes

Change  State           Description
------- -------         -------------
   1    being_reviewed  Place under aegis
robyn%
.E)
Any of the above changes could be reviewed,
Robyn chooses the first.
.E(
robyn% \f(CBaecd -p example -c 1\fP
aegis: project "example": change 1: /u/pat/example.001
robyn% \f(CBaedmore\fP
\fI\&.\&.\&.examines each file.\&.\&.\fP
robyn%
.E)
The
.I aedmore
command walks the development directory tree to find all of
the "comma D" files, and displays them using
.IR more (1)
There is a corresponding
.I aedless
for those who prefer the
.IR less (1)
command.
.LP
Once the change has been reviewed and found acceptable,
it is passed:
.E(
robyn% \f(CBaerpass example 1\fP
aegis: sh /usr/local/lib/aegis/rp.sh example 1 pat robyn
aegis: project "example": change 1: passed review
robyn%
.E)
Some time soon Isa will notice the email
notification and commence integration of the change.
.nh 3 "The Second Change"
.LP
Most reviews have the same pattern as the first.
.E(
robyn% \f(CBaerpass -l -p example\fP

.LP
Always change directory to the change's development directory,
otherwise you will not be able to review the files.
.E(
robyn% \f(CBaecd -p example -c 2\fP
aegis: project "example": change 2: /u/jan/example.002
robyn%
.E)
.LP
Another useful way of finding out about a change
is the "list change details" command, viz:
.E(
robyn% \f(CBael cd -p example -c 2\fP
 
Project "example", Change 2

Once Robyn knows what the change is meant to be doing,
the files are then examined:
.E(
robyn% \f(CBaedmore\fP
\fI\&.\&.\&.examines each file.\&.\&.\fP
robyn%
.E)
.LP
Once the change is found to be acceptable,
it is passed:
.E(
robyn% \f(CBaerpass example 2\fP
aegis: sh /usr/local/lib/aegis/rp.sh example 2 jan robyn
aegis: project "example": change 2: passed review
robyn%
.E)
.LP
Some time soon Isa will notice the email
notification and commence integration of the change.
.LP
The reviews of the third and fourth changes will
not be given here,
because they are almost identical to the other changes.
If you want to know how to fail a review,
see the
.IR aerfail (1)
manual entry.
.nh 3 "Reviewer Command Summary"
.LP
Only a few of the aegis commands available to reviewers have
been used in this example.
The following table (very tersely) describes the aegis commands
most useful to reviewers.
.sp
.TS
center,tab(;);
l l.
Command;Description
_
aecd;Change Directory
aerpass;Review Pass
aerpu;Review Pass Undo
aerfail;Review Fail
ael;List Stuff
.TE
.LP
You will want to read the manual entries for all of these commands.
Note that all aegis commands have a
.I \-Help
option,
which will give a result very similar to the
corresponding
.I man (1)
output.
Most aegis commands also have a
.I \-List
option,
which usually lists interesting context sensitive information.
