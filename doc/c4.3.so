.nh 2 "Other Packages"
.LP
This section briefly discusses other DMTs
which are known to the author
and are known to be inadequate.
.nh 3 "Traditional Make"
.LP
The
.I make (1)
which comes with most flavors of
.UX
is inadequate for both requirements:
it has no dependency search path,
and it has no dynamic include file dependecy facility.
Many also have no ability to include files in the Makefiles,
and have no ability to collect the output of a shell command.
.nh 3 "GNU make"
.LP
The version of GNU make evaluated in writing this section was 3.62.
A later version may be more capable.
.LP
The GNU make program hase the dependency search path,
in the form of its
.I VPATH
variable,
but it has no dynamic include file dependency facility.
It does have the ability to include files in the Makefiles,
and the ability to collect the output of a shell command.
