.nh 2 "The Administrator"
.LP
The previous discussion of developers, reviewers and integrators
has covered many aspects of the production of software using the aegis program.
The administrator has responsibility for everything they don't,
but there is very little left.
.LP
These responsibilities include:
.LP
\(bu access control:
The administrator adds and removes all categories of user,
including administrators.
This is on a per-project basis,
and has nothing to do with 
.UX
user administration.
This simply nominates which users may do what.
.LP
\(bu change creation:
The administrator adds (and sometimes removes) changes to the system.
At later stages,
developers may alter some attributes of the change,
such as the description,
to say what they fixed.
.LP
\(bu project creation:
The aegis program does not limit who may create projects,
but when a project is created the user who created the project
is set to be the administrator of that project.
.LP
All of these things will be examined 
.nh 3 "The First Change"
.LP
Many things need to happen before
development can begin on
the first change;
the project must be created,
the staff but be given access permissions,
the change must be created.
.E(
alex% \f(CBaenpr example -dir /projects/example\fP
aegis: project "example": project directory "/projects/example"
aegis: project "example": created
alex%
.E)
Once the project has been created,
the project attributes are set.
Alex will set the desired project attributes using the
.B -Edit
option of the
.B aepa
command.
This will invoke an editor (\fIvi\fP(1) by default)
to edit the project attributes.
Alex edits them to look like this:
.E(
description = "Aegis Documentation Example Project";
developer_may_review = false;
developer_may_integrate = false;
reviewer_may_integrate = false;
.E)
The project attributes are set as follows:
.E(
alex% \f(CBaepa -edit -p example\fP
\fI\&...edit as above...\fP
aegis: project "example": attributes changed
alex% \f(CBael p\fP
List of Projects

Project Directory               Description
------- -----------             -------------
example /projects/example       Aegis Documentation Example
                                Project
alex%
.E)
The various staff must be added to the project.
Developers are the only staff who may actually edit files.
.E(
alex% \f(CBaend pat jan sam -p example\fP
aegis: project "example": user "pat" is now a developer
aegis: project "example": user "jan" is now a developer
aegis: project "example": user "sam" is now a developer
alex%
.E)
Reviewers may veto a change.
There may be overlap between the various categories,
as show here for Jan:
.E(
alex% \f(CBaenr robyn jan -p example\fP
aegis: project "example": user "robyn" is now a reviewer
aegis: project "example": user "jan" is now a reviewer
alex%
.E)
The next role we need to fill is an integrator.
.E(
alex% \f(CBaeni isa -p example\fP
aegis: project "example": user "isa" is now an integrator
alex%
.E)
Once the staff have been given access,
Alex creates the first change.
The
.B -Edit
option of the
.B annc
command is used,
to create the attributes of the change.
They are edited to look like this:
.E(
brief_description = "Create initial skeleton.";
description = "A simple calculator using native \e
floating point precision.  \e
The four basic arithmetic operators to be provided, \e
using conventional infix notation.  \e
Parentheses and negation also required.";
cause = internal_enhancement;
.E)
The change is created as follows:
.E(
alex% \f(CBaenc -edit -p example\fP
\fI\&...edit as above...\fP
aegis: project "example": change 1: created
alex%
.E)
At this point,
Alex walks down the hall to Pat's office,
to ask Pat to develop the first change.
Pat has had some practice using aegis,
and can be relied on to do the rest of the project configuration speedily.
.nh 3 "The Second Change"
.LP
Some time later,
Alex patiently sits through the whining and grumbling of an
especially pedantic user.
The following change description is duly entered:
.E(
brief_description = "file names on command line";
description = "Optional input and output files may be \e
specified on the command line.";
cause = internal_bug;
.E)
.LP
The pedantic user wanted to be able to name
files on the command line,
rather than use I/O redirection.
Also,
having a bug in this example is useful.
The change is created as follows:
.E(
alex% \f(CBaenc -edit -p example\fP
\fI\&...edit as above...\fP
aegis: project "example": change 2: created
alex%
.E)
At some point a developer will notice this change
and start work on it.
.nh 3 "The Third Change"
.LP
Other features are required for the calculator,
and also for this example.
The second change adds exponentiation to the calculator,
and is described as follows:
.E(
brief_description = "add powers";
description = "Enhance the grammar to allow exponentiation.  \e
No error checking required.";
cause = internal_enhancement;
.E)
.LP
The change is created as follows:
.E(
alex% \f(CBaenc -edit -p example\fP
\fI\&...edit as above...\fP
aegis: project "example": change 3: created
alex%
.E)
At some point a developer will notice,
and this change will be worked on.
.nh 3 "The Fourth Change"
.LP
A fourth change,
this time adding variables to the calculator
is added.
.E(
brief_description = "add variables";
description = "Enhance the grammar to allow variables.  \e
Only single letter variable names are required.";
cause = internal_enhancement;
.E)
.LP
The change is created as follows:
.E(
alex% \f(CBaenc -edit -p example\fP
\fI\&...edit as above...\fP
aegis: project "example": change 4: created
alex%
.E)
At some point a developer will notice,
and this change will be worked on.
.nh 3 "Administrator Command Summary"
.LP
Only a few of the aegis commands available to administrators have
been used in this example.
The following table lists the aegis commands most useful to administrators.
.sp
.TS
center,tab(;);
l l.

.TE
.LP
You will want to read the manual entries for all of these commands.
Note that all aegis commands have a
.I \-Help
option,
which will give a result very similar to the
corresponding
.I man (1)
output.
Most aegis commands also have a
.I \-List
option,
which usually lists interesting context sensitive information.
