.LP
This chapter has given a vicarious view of what using aegis feels like.
As a next step in getting to know aegis,
it would be a good idea if you created a project and
went through this same exercise;
you could use this exact example,
or you could use a similar small project.
This idea simply to run through many of the same steps as in the example.
Typos and other natural events will ensure that you come across
a number of situations not directly covered by this chapter.

If you have not already done do,
a printed copy of the section 1 and 5 manual entries will be invaluable.
If you don't want to use that many trees,
they will be available on-line,
by using the "-Help" option of the appropriate command variant.
Try:
.E(
% \f(CBaedb -help\fP
\&.\&.\&.manual entry\&.\&.\&.
%

Note that this example has not demonstrated all of the available functionality.
One item of particular interest is that tests,
like any other source file,
may be copied into a change and modified,
or even deleted,
just like any other source file.
