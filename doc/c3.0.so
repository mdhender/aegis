.nh 1 "The History Tool"
.LP
The aegis program is decoupled from the history mechanism.
This allows you to use the history mechanism of your choice,
SCCS or RCS, for example.
You may even wish to write your own.
.LP
The intention of this is that you may use a history mechanism which
suits your special needs,
or the one that comes free with your flavour of 
.UX
operating system.
.LP
The aegis program uses the history mechanism for file
.I history
and so does not require many of the features of SCCS or RCS.
This simplistic approach can sometimes make the interface to these
utilities look a little strange.
.nh 2 "Interfacing"
.LP
The history mechanism interface is found in the
project configuration file called
.I "config" ,
relative to the root of the baseline.
It is a source file and subject to the same controls
as any other source file.
The history fields of the file are described as follows
