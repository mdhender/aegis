.nh 2 "Interfacing"
.LP
The build commands are accessed from two fields of the
project configuration file (\fIconfig\fP).
.nh 3 "diff_command"
.LP

.I aed (1)
to produce a difference listing when file in the development directory
was originally copied from the current version in the baseline\**.
.FS
Or this is logically the case.
.FE
.LP
All of the command substitutions described in

.IP ${ORiginal}
The absolute path name of a file containing the version originally copied.
Usually in the baseline.
.IP ${Input}
The absolute path name of the edited version of the file.
Usually in the development directory.
.IP ${Output}
The absolute path name of the file in which to write the difference listing.
Usually in the development directory.
.LP
An exit status of 0 means successful,
even of the files differ (and they usually do).
An exit status which is non-zero means something is wrong.
.LP
The non-zero exit status may be used to overload this command
with extra tests,
such as line length limits.
The difference files must be produced in addition to these extra tests.

.LP
This command is used by
.I aed (1)
to produce a difference listing when file in the development directory

.IP ${Most_Recent}

.IP ${Output}
