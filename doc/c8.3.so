.nh 2 "Using fhist"
.LP
The
.B fhist
program by David I. Bell
also comes with two other utilities,
.I fcomp
and
.I fmerge ,
which use the same minimal diference algorithm.
.nh 3 "diff_command"
.LP
See the earlier
.I Interfacing
section for substitution details.
.LP
The entry in the
.I config
file looks like this:
.E(
diff_command =
        "fcomp -w $original $input -o $output";
.E)
.LP
The
.B -w
option produces an output of the entire file,
with insertions an deletions marked by "change bars" in the left margin.
This is superior to context difference,
as it shows the entire file as context.
.LP
For more information,
see the
.I fcomp (1)
manual entry.
.nh 3 "diff3_command"
.LP
See the earlier
.I Interfacing
section for substitution details.
.LP
The entry in the
.I config
file looks like this:
.E(
diff3_command =
        "fmerge $original $MostRecent $input -o $output -c /dev/null";
.E)
.LP
The output of this command is similar to the output of the diff3_command
in the last section.
Conflicts are marked in the output.
For more information,
see the
.I fmerge (1)
manual entry.
